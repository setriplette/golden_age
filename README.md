Welcome to Golden Age!
This is my repository for the Lope de Vega's Golden Age digital humanities project, initiated in September 2016 as part of the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg's Digital Humanities Course. We are using TEI and xml to identify thematic and citational networks within Lope de Vega's literary works. One of our major research questions investigates Lope's language of affect, emotion, and feeling. We would like to answer the following questions: 1) Is the language of affect gendered? 2) does Lope juxtapose the discourse of affect with other discourses (landscape, law, honor, the body etc) 3) Does the language of affect vary by genre? Can we describe a Lope's vocbulary of affect, emotion, and feeling, and can we theorize how the plays use this vocabulary to transfer affect from characters to audience?
