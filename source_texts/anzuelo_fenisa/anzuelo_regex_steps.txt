Anzuelo regex steps

Started from wikisource's print version which I saved to PDF and then copied. This deleted most of the web formatting.

https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/El_anzuelo_de_Fenisa_(Versión_para_imprimir)

1. To get rid of wikisource attribution at end of every page
 Find El anzuelo de Fenisa \(.+\n.+\n
 replace with nothing
 
 2. To get rid of what I think is the footer, which begins with Pag. and then has page number and the name of the play again
Pág\.\s.+\nE.+Carpio\n

3. Analysis of play parts. 
    1. I have character names in all caps and a cast list of them at the top.
    2. I have three acts, named with Roman numeral, Acto I, II, and III
    3. I have one Aparte, which is a stage direction
    4. I have several Sale/n, which is the stage direction for Enter
    5. I have several Vanse, which is the stage direction for Exit. Also several Vase, stage direction for Exit in the singular.
    6. Remain unsure about other stage directions until I read through the play.
    7. No Escenas in this version, thankfully. Those are added by editors to Lope plays and occur every time a character ends or leaves, so I would remove them if they did exist.

4. Wrap lines
    Find ^.+$
    Replace <l>\0</l>
    
5. Remove lines from cast list. Select cast list, regex for selection only
    Find <l> and replace with nothing
    Find </l> and replace with nothing

6. Remove lines around Actos
    Find <l>(Acto\s[I]+)</l>
    Replace \1
    
7. Grabbed my speakers with [A-ZÁÉÍÚÑ][A-ZÁÉÍÚÑ]+\s*[A-ZÁÉÍÚÑ]+
What do I do about the y (and) between some speaker names? They are in stage directions, so maybe I should get rid of the <l></l> around stage direction before I grab speakers.

8. Remove <l> around stage directions

    Find <l>(Sale.+\.)</l>
    Replace /1
    
    Find <l>(Vase.+\.)</l>
    Replace \1
    
    Find <l>(Vanse.+\.)</l>
    Replace \1
    
    Find 
    <l>(Entra.+\.)</l>
    \1
9. Remove <l> around speakers
    Find <l>([A-ZÁÉÍÚ]+:)</l>
    Replace /1
    
10. Tag speakers
    ([A-ZÁÉÍÚ]+:)
    <speaker>\1</speaker>
    
11. Deal with stage directions
    
    (Entra.+[A-Z]+.+\.)
    <stage>\1</stage>
    
    Moved two that had Entran after Vanse by hand. Probably bad idea
    
    Find (Sale.+[A-Z]+.+\.)
    <stage>\1</stage>
    
    Find (Vase.+[A-Z]+.+\.)
    Replace <stage>\1</stage>
    
    Find (Vanse.+[A-Z]+.+\.)
    Replace <stage>\1</stage>
    
    Dealt with the 1 Aparte by hand

12. Assess double stage on some of the vanses. Ended up hand correcting, which might cause problems later.

13. Need to use clopen strategy to grab speakers. Trying this and failing caused me to discover problems with Tribiño and Don Félix because of their special characters. Fixed.

14. Still failing to clopen. My idea was to use speaker, but I am finding it hard to make the thing look over line numbers.

15. Trying something simpler
    Find <speaker>
    Replace </sp><speaker>
    
    Find </sp><speaker>
    Replace </sp><sp><speaker>
    
    Worry that I will have problems with stage directions
    
    I do!
    
16. Fix sp around stage directions
    Find (</l>)(<stage>.+</stage>)</sp>
    Replace \1</sp>\2
    
    Check and see if this worked. Seems like it. Phew! Moved my first </sp> to the end.
    
 17. Make Acts into divs
    Find Acto\s([I]+)
    Replace </div><div type="act" number="\1">\0
    
    Move the first </div> to the bottom
 
 18. Get rid of colon after speakers' names
    Find (<speaker>[A-ZÁÉÍÚ]+):
    Replace \1
 
 19. Add white space around speeches
    Find (</sp>)(<sp>)
    Replace \1\n\2
