Anzuelo regex steps

Started from wikisource's print version which I saved to PDF and then copied. This deleted most of the web formatting.

https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/El_anzuelo_de_Fenisa_(Versión_para_imprimir)

1. To get rid of wikisource attribution at end of every page
 Find El anzuelo de Fenisa \(.+\n.+\n
 replace with nothing
 
 2. To get rid of what I think is the footer, which begins with Pag. and then has page number and the name of the play again
Pág\.\s.+\nE.+Carpio\n
