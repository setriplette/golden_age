Dama boba regex steps

1. Special chars: not found

2. Find \n{3,}
   Replace \n\n

3. Wrap lines
    Find ^.+$
    Replace <l>\0</l>

4. Notice I have some blank <l></l> with or without two spaces
    Find <l>\s*</l>
    /n

5. I'll want to grab speaker and where appropriate move opening <l> to after their name
    Find [A-ZÍÚ][A-ZÍÚ]+\s*[A-ZÍÚ]+
    Holding off, bc I'm grabbing Roman numerals from my escenas too. I'm going to change those to Arabic numeral first

6. First I'm ridding myself of the [editar] in 19 of the scenes
    Find (Escena\s[IVLXC]+)\[editar]
    Replace \1

7. Realize some Escenas have brackets. Will have to do two groups for each numeral
    Find <l>(Escena)\sI\<\/l\>
    Replace \1 1
    Repeat for Roman numerals up to 19 for out of brackets and 49 for in. Realize whoever cut these scenes made a new scene whenever characters 
    enter. Garbage. Consider removing scene breaks altogether down the road.
    Stopped on 34 for now
    
8. Select cast list, regex for selection only
    Find <l> and replace with nothing
    Find </l> and replace with nothing

9.  Take line numbers off act numbers
    Find <l>(Acto\s[I]+)</l>
    Replace \1
    
10. Look at stage directions and (sic) situations in brackets. Find 199. Manually look though for the few sic and supplied and tag manually.
    Find \[.+?\] and go through list
    
11. Realize I have some stage directions weirdness with Entre and Entren. What's happening is that the person who did the edition marked
a new scene every time a new character entered and listed who was still on stage. "Dichos" seems to mean that everyone from the previous
scene remains. This is why there are fifty "scenes" in Act II. I still have to figure out whether this is the traditional means of 
marking scenes in Lope's plays but it is really annoying. Find Entre and Entren and move the brackets around the whole thing
    Find Entre and make sure the brackets are around the whole stage direction

12. I realize now that some of the stage directions are in parentheses and some aren't marked. I'm going to work with brackets, then parentheses,
and have to catch the unmarked ones by old-fashioned proofreading
    Find \[.+?\]

13 I decide to deal with the stage directions that are whole line first
    Find <l>\[(.+?)\]</l>
    Replace <stage>\1</stage>
    That's 99

14. I deal with the ones that are partial lines. 
    Find \[(.+?)\]
    I realize that there are a few missing end brackets so I go through and manually add those so I don't grab too much
    Replace <stage>\1</stage>

15. Look at stage directions now to see that I grabbed the right things
    <stage>.+?</stage>
    There's a lot of inconsistent format, and I manually clean it out around the stage directions
    Realize I also have a situation where metrical lines are often shared between characters. Ugh. I will auto-number lines and they
    will be approximate. 

16. I'd like to move the line markers around speakers to their proper place. 
    Find <l>([A-ZÍÚ]+:*\s*)([¿¡A-Z])
    Replace \1<l>\2
    
17. Get rid of excess line returns
    Find \n{3,}
    Replace \n\n

18. To find speeches
    Find ^[A-ZÍÚ][A-ZÍÚ]+.+?\n\n
    
    Before replacing I am going through by hand to make sure I didn't pick up extraneous stuff.
    Format very inconsistent here so I did, but this makes it easy to see.
    I fix a bunch of weird stuff. Irregular expressions!
    
    Find (^[A-ZÍÚ][A-ZÍÚ]+.+?)(\n\n)
    Replace <sp>\1</sp>\2

19. Clopen Escena
    Find Escena\s(\d+)
    Replace</div><div type="scene" n="\1">\0
    move top </div> to bottom

20. Add in a little whitespace
    Find (</div>)(<div type="scene")
    Replace \1\n\n\2

21. CLopen Acts
    Find Acto\s([I]+)
    Replace </div><div type="act" number="\1">\0

22. Remove line numbers in preparatiown for auto-numbering later
    Find \s\d+(</l>)
    Replace \1

23. Tag speaker
    Find (<sp>)([A-ZÍÚ]+)(\s*<l>)
    Replace \1<speaker>\2</speaker>\3

24. Tag group of speakers that had colon
    Find (<sp>)([A-ZÍÚ]+):*(\s*<l>)
    Replace \1<speaker>\2</speaker>\3

25. Remove pseudomarkup scene markings
    Find Escena\s\d+
    Replace with nothing
    Do same with act

26. Find speakers around apartes
    Find (<sp>)([A-ZÍÚ]+):(\s*<stage>)
    Replace \1<speaker>\2</speaker>\3
    
27. Cleanup around stage directions
    Find (</stage>):
    Replace \1
