Document Structure:
<TEI>
    <teiHeader> 
        Everything that goes in the header.
    </teiHeader>
    <text>
        <body>
            <div type="book">
                <head>Heading</head>
                <p>Text</p>
                <div type="narrative">
                    <head type="narrative">Head</head>
                    <q><p>Story Text</p></q>
                </div>
            </div>

Up-Conversion Process:

1.Delete the extra text at the beginning and end of the document.
2.Searched for special characters &, <, and >. I found 2 instances of the & and replaced them with &amp;.
3.I looked up the paragraphs:
    Find: \n\n
    Replace with: </p>\0<p>
Then I deleted the extra <p> and </p> in the document. I also manually removed the p tags around the beginning few lines like the author and title.
4.Next I found the books and wrapped them:
    Find: ^<p>(.+Book.+)</p>($)(\n\n)<p>(.+)</p>
    Replace with: \1\2</book>\3<book>\4
I manually added a <book> at the beginning of the first book and a </book> at the end of the text.
7.The chapter titles were next:
    Find:^(<book>)(.+$)
    Replace with:\1<head>\2</head>
8.I realized after this that <book> is incorrect with the TEI structure so I went back to change it to div:
    Find:</book>
    Replace with:</div>
9.Next I found the sub-headings that marked the start of the narratives within the books. Four out of the five were labelled as a history:
    Find: <p>(The History.+)</p>$
    Replace with: <head subtype="narrative">\1</head>
    Find: <p>(The History.+)$
    Replace with: <head subtype="narrative">\1</head>
The fifth narrative was titled as a story:
    Find: <p>(The Story.+)$
    Replace with: Replace with: <head subtype="narrative">\1</head>
10.Next I found the quotations in the text:
    Find: "([A-Z].+?)"
    Replace: <q>\1</q>
As I looked through the <q> tags, I realized I would have a hierarchy issue as the <q> was inside a <p> but extended past just one <p>. To fix this, I manually went through and moved the <q> and </q> tags outside of the <p> tags so the hierarchy of the document would be preserved. I also noticed that underneath two of the <head subtype="narrative"> there were <p> lacking due to no double space. I added those in.
11. Then I decided to wrap the narratives in a separate div.
    Find: <head type="narrative">
    Replace with: <div type="narrative">\0
Then:
    Find: </q>
    Replace with: \0</div>
And for the continuation of some stories in the middle of the book text:
    Find: <q>
Then I manually added <div type="narrative"> where the quote occurred in the middle of the text.
