Up-Conversion Process:

1.Delete the extra text at the beginning and end of the document.
2.Searched for special characters &, <, and >. I found 2 instances of the & and replaced them with &amp;.
3.I looked up the paragraphs:
    Find: \n\n
    Replace with: </p>\0<p>
Then I deleted the extra <p> and </p> in the document. I also manually removed the p tags around the beginning few lines like the author and title.
4.Next I found the books and wrapped them:
    Find: ^<p>(.+Book.+)</p>($)(\n\n)<p>(.+)</p>
    Replace with: \1\2</book>\3<book>\4
I manually added a <book> at the beginning of the first book and a </book> at the end of the text.
7.The chapter titles were next:
    Find:^(<book>)(.+$)
    Replace with:\1<head>\2</head>
8.I realized after this that <book> is incorrect with the TEI structure so I went back to change it to div:
    Find:</book>
    Replace with:</div>
9.Next I found the sub-headings that marked the start of the narratives within the books. Four out of the five were labelled as a history:
    Find: <p>(The History.+)</p>$
    Replace with: <head subtype="narrative">\1</head>
    Find: <p>(The History.+)$
    Replace with: <head subtype="narrative">\1</head>
The fifth narrative was titled as a story:
    Find: <p>(The Story.+)$
    Replace with: Replace with: <head subtype="narrative">\1</head>
10.Next I found the quotations in the text:
    Find: "([A-Z].+?)"
    Replace: <q>\1</q>
As I looked through the <q> tags, I realized I would have a hierarchy issue as the <q> was inside a <p> but extended past just one <p>. To fix this, I manually went through and moved the <q> and </q> tags outside of the <p> tags so the hierarchy of the document would be preserved. I also noticed that underneath two of the <head subtype="narrative"> there were <p> lacking due to no double space. I added those in.
11. Then I decided to wrap the narratives in a separate div.
    Find: <head type="narrative">
    Replace with: <div type="narrative">\0
Then:
    Find: </q>
    Replace with: \0</div>
And for the continuation of some stories in the middle of the book text:
    Find: <q>
Then I manually added <div type="narrative"> where the quote occurred in the middle of the text.
12.I found that <div> did not work around the narrative so I changed them to floating text:
    Find: <div type="narrative">
    Replace with: <floatingText type="narrative">
    
    Find: (</q>)</div>
    Replace with: \1</body></floatingText>
    
    Find: <q>
    Replace with: <body>\0
I went through everything once again to make sure all 8 separate blocks of text related to the narratives were correctly tagged according to the structure above.
13. To finish off the tagging of the body, I enclosed the whole text in <text><body> elements:
    Find: <div type="book"><head>The First Book
    Replace with: <text><body>\0
Then I manually added the tags </body></text> to the end of the text
14.Next I focused on creating a TEI header. I started with the beginning of the text:
    Find: ^The Pilgrim of Castile.+$
    Replace with: <TEI><teiHeader><fileDesc><titleStmt><title>\0</title></titleStmt><publicationStmt><p>
I then continued on:
    Find: ^by Lope.+$
    Replace with:\0</p></publicationStmt><sourceDesc><p>
    
    Find: ^published.+$
    Replace with: \0</p></sourceDesc></fileDesc></teiHeader>
15.For my final step with the basic structure was to add a </TEI> to the very end of the text.
16.I converted the text to XML and found a few issues in the text. I went through manually and fixed them. I had to go through and move the <body> tags outside of the <head type="narrative"> tags as this was a strucutural issue.
17.Another issue was I was missing some <p> tags around the lines that announced the end of the books. I went through manually and added them where needed.
18.I converted the document once again and found Oxygen was all green and good to go.
19.After the general structure was tagged, I moved on to taggin emotions with in the text. I read through most of the text and wrote down all the different possible emotion words, metaphors, or phrases that I could find. From there, I started searching and replacing all those words. I won't list all of those Finds and Replace withs but my general search looked like:
    Find:( )(emotion)([\.]*[\,]*[;]* )
    Replace with:\1<emotion type="part of speech">\2</emotion>\3
