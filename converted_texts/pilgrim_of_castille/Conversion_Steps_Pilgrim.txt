Up-Conversion Process:

1.Delete the extra text at the beginning and end of the document.
2.Searched for special characters &, <, and >. I found 2 instances of the & and replaced them with &amp;.
3.Next I found the quotations in the text:
    Find: "(.+?)"
    Replace: <q>\1</q>
4.I looked up the paragraphs:
    Find: \n\n
    Replace with: </p>\0<p>
Then I deleted the extra <p> and </p> in the document. I also manually removed the p tags around the beginning few lines like the author and title.
5.Next I found the books and wrapped them:
    Find: ^<p>(.+Book.+)</p>($)(\n\n)<p>(.+)</p>
    Replace with: \1\2</book>\3<book>\4
I manually added a <book> at the beginning of the first book and a </book> at the end of the text.
6.The chapter titles were next:
    Find:^(<book>)(.+$)
    Replace with:\1<head>\2</head>
7.I realized after this that <book> is incorrect with the TEI structure so I went back to change it to div:
    Find:</book>
    Replace with:</div>
8.Next I found the sub-headings that marked the start of the narratives within the books. Four out of the five were labelled as a history:
    Find: <p>(The History.+)</p>$
    Replace with: <head subtype="narrative">\1</head>
    Find: <p>(The History.+)$
    Replace with: <head subtype="narrative">\1</head>
The fifth narrative was titled as a story:
    Find: <p>(The Story.+)$
    Replace with: Replace with: <head subtype="narrative">\1</head>
