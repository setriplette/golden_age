Dama boba regex steps

1. Special chars: not found

2. Find \n{3,}
   Replace \n\n

3. Wrap lines
    Find ^.+$
    Replace <l>\0</l>

4. Notice I have some blank <l></l> with or without two spaces
    Find <l>\s*</l>
    /n

5. I'll want to grab speaker and where appropriate move opening <l> to after their name
    Find [A-ZÍÚ][A-ZÍÚ]+\s*[A-ZÍÚ]+
    Holding off, bc I'm grabbing Roman numerals from my escenas too. I'm going to change those to Arabic numeral first

6. First I'm ridding myself of the [editar] in 19 of the scenes
    Find (Escena\s[IVLXC]+)\[editar]
    Replace \1

7. Realize some Escenas have brackets. Will have to do two groups for each numeral
    Find <l>(Escena)\sI\<\/l\>
    Replace \1 1
    Repeat for Roman numerals up to 19 for out of brackets and 49 for in. Realize whoever cut these scenes made a new scene whenever characters enter. Garbage. Consider removing scene breaks altogether down the road.
