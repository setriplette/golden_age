        <h2 class="projectAbout">Research Question</h2>
        
        <p class="projectAbout">This project investigates the correlation of the language of the body and emotion with
            gender, genre, character, medical vocabulary, geography, and other phenomena in the Lope
            de Vega corpus.</p>
        <h2 class="projectAbout">TEI encoding</h2>
        <p class="projectAbout">In order to quantify Lope's use of certain lexical items, we use TEI encoding to flag
            words and phrases of interest as well as the names of people and places. When we tag
            emotion, we also identify the part of speech of the word. The texts presented as reading views on the site were
        prepared as xml documents with TEI markup.</p>
        <h2 class="projectAbout">Close and distant reading</h2>
        <p class="projectAbout">In the first phase of the project we have three coded texts addressed in isolation. In order to identify the language of body and emotion,
        we conducted close reading on all the texts. Our results suggest useful comparisons among characters in the plays, but we plan to expand the corpus
        in order to understand how Lope uses emotion and the body across a broader range of texts. In the long term, we plan to use a combination of close and (when
        there are enough texts) distant reading techniques to create a model for Lope's use of these vocabularies. The next phase of the project will compare
        five plays with female protagonists to five plays with male protagonists.</p>
