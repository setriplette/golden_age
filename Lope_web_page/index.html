        <p class="homePage">The Lope de Vega Project examines a selection of texts available in the public domain by early modern Spanish playwright FÃ©lix Lope de Vega y Carpio (1562-1635). A figure comparable to Shakespeare, Lope de Vega wrote approximately 500 plays, of which some 300 survive. The Lope de Vega Project identifies the co-occurrence of emotion, gender, the body, and honor in several different works. In his manifesto on theatre, The New Art of Comedy, Lope de Vega wrote that the purpose of a play is to evoke strong emotion in an audience of ordinary people. The Lope project tests this idea by using computer code to determine whether emotion correlates with gender, class, or age and whether the representation of emotion in Lopes plays corresponds to the humoral theories that dominated early modern Castilian medical texts.</p>
