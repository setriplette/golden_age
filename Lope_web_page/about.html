        <h2 class="projectAbout">The Lope Project</h2>
        <p class="projectAbout">This digital humanities research project began as part of Elisa Beshero Bondar's Coding
            and Digital Archives class in Fall 2016. We convert Lope de Vega texts available in the
            public domain to XML following the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative. Our goal
            is to offer the public new ways to see the Lope texts. This
            project's central research questions focus on emotion and the body, but we offer reading
            views and visualizations of various aspects of the texts as a service to students and
            scholars. All of our work is licensed through Creative Commons and may be used for any non-commercial purpose as long as proper credit is given.</p>
        <h2 class="projectAbout">Research Question</h2>
        
        <p class="projectAbout">This project investigates the correlation of the language of the body and emotion with
            gender, genre, character, medical vocabulary, geography, and other phenomena in the Lope
            de Vega corpus.</p>
        <h2 class="projectAbout">TEI Encoding</h2>
        <p class="projectAbout">In order to quantify Lope's use of certain lexical items, we use TEI encoding to flag
            words and phrases of interest as well as the names of people and places. When we tag
            emotion, we also identify the part of speech of the word. The texts presented as reading views on the site were
            prepared as xml documents with TEI markup.</p>
        <h2 class="projectAbout">Close and Distant Reading</h2>
        <p class="projectAbout">In the first phase of the project we have three coded texts addressed in isolation. In order to identify the language of body and emotion,
            we conducted close reading on all the texts. Our results suggest useful ways to read these individual texts, but in the long term, we plan to compare
            texts to each other. Ultimately we plan to use a combination of close and 
            distant reading techniques to theorize Lope's use of our targeted semantic fields. The next phase of the project will compare
            five plays with female protagonists to five plays with male protagonists.</p>
