        <h2 class="projectAbout">The Lope Project</h2>
        <p class="projectAbout">This digital humanities research project began as part of Elisa Beshero Bondar's Coding
            and Digital Archives class in Fall 2016. We convert Lope de Vega texts available in the
            public domain to XML following the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative. Our goal
            is to offer the public new ways to see the Lope texts. This
            project's central research questions focus on emotion and the body, but we offer reading
            views and visualizations of various aspects of the texts as a service to students and
            scholars. All of our work is licensed through Creative Commons and may be used for any non-commercial purpose as long as proper credit is given.</p>
