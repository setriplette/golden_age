         <p class="prose">Upon the shore of <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>, between the planks of a ship which
            had suffered wreck, there appeared as if it had been a parcel of cloth covered with
            weed:
            which being perceived by some fishermen, they took it into their bark, and carried
            it
            along the shore about the space of two miles, where under the shade of some trees,
            they
            cleaned away the weeds and mud, and found that it was a man in a trance, who was almost
            past sense, and without life. These fishers, moved with compassion, kindled a fire
            with
            some branches cut from an old oak, and he who had been so near the losing of his life,
            now
            recovering it, let them know what countryman he was, by his complaint: discovered
            his
            admiration by his looks; and the feeling he had of the good which they had done him,
            by
            the fire with which he had to acknowledge it. Nature, doing the accustomed office
            of a
            pitiful mother, sent his blood to restore the more enfeebled parts; and having brought
            him
            almost to his former strength, he was about to have revealed himself: but thinking
            it did
            not fit in so strange a fortune, he concealed his birth and name, only saying that
            his
            ship suffered wreck in the sea, and seizing of these planks which the waves had cast
            upon
            the shore, he was two days floating amongst the billows of the sea, who sometimes
            merciful
            and then again cruel, did bring him nearer and then farther from the land, until such
            time
            that the reflux of the water vanquishing the impetuosity of the tempest, he was cast
            upon
            the sands, where the violence of the stroke having as it were ploughed up his tomb,
            he
            thought himself buried. His return (he said) was from <span class="placeName">Italy</span>, and
            the occasion of his voyage the indulgences of the Jubilee, which was while
            <span class="persName">Clement the Eighth</span> sat as Pope. And sighing much, amongst the
            broken speeches of his story, he let them understand that he missed a companion of
            his
            travels, of whom there was no news to be had, as it seldom happens that those who
            do free
            us from bodily misfortunes can also ease those of the mind. So he rested this day
            within
            one of their cabins, while the cold night descending, all crowned with stars, did
            impart
            unto mortal creatures rest in conformity with the quality of their lives, giving <span class="emotion" title="verb">desires</span> unto the poor, cares unto the rich, complaints
            unto the <span class="emotion" title="adj">sad</span>, unto the <span class="emotion" title="adj">contented</span> sleep, and <span class="emotion" title="noun">jealousy</span> to the amorous.
            In the midst thereof he heard a lyre played upon, and according with a voice, which
            in
            singing complained of a shepherdess's cruelty. The pilgrim, although <span class="emotion" title="adj">weary</span>, <span class="emotion" title="verb">loved</span> music more than rest, and
            went out of his cabin into a meadow, from whence seeing about a dozen houses, and
            among
            some osiers the author of those plaints, called him from a distance. The singer replied
            <span class="emotion" title="adverb">fearfully</span>, but the pale light of the moon,
            revealing the secrets of the night, made him see that it was a poor man, and without
            <span class="body">arms</span>. He then showed him a plank lying amongst reeds over a little
            brook, giving its murmuring unto the solitariness of the place and silence of the
            night;
            which when he had passed, they saluted one the other courteously, especially he which
            came
            (for strangers are always courteous out of necessity); and they sat down together
            upon the
            grass.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">No sooner had the pilgrim informed himself of the name of the village, of the lord
            thereof, and how far it was distant from <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>, when they saw
            two men approaching, who instead of saluting them presented two arquebuses to their
            faces,
            and instilled a thousand fears in their <span class="body">hearts</span>. The stranger told
            them that they could take nothing from them but his life--which he esteemed little
            (and
            six hours ago much less): the other said that he was the son of a seaman--between
            a
            fisherman and a pilot--and that all his goods consisted of this his instrument, with
            which
            he did charm away his cares. The soldiers did not appear to <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> their clothes, because one was of ship's canvas and the other of coarse
            cloth; and there is no robber who is not liberal of that which is of no worth. But
            they
            entreated them to conduct them to the village, which in regard to the uncertainty
            of the
            way they could not find but in a great time. The fisherman told them that in recompense
            for their courtesy he would advise them not to go, forasmuch as the inhabitants were
            a
            warlike people, and did not willingly lodge men of their fashion; and that it would
            be
            impossible to escape from their <span class="body">hands</span> if they were discovered,
            because upon the sounding of the first alarm, all the other villages would answer
            them,
            from whom would come a multitude of labourers, who with divers <span class="body">arms</span>
            would stop the passages, and knew the ways so well that there was neither brook, tree
            nor
            rock which they had not at their <span class="body">fingers'</span> ends. To this counsel the
            bandoleers replied that they were not alone; but there were above fifty in their troupe,
            fighting under the colours of a Catalonian knight, who had been injured by another
            more
            mighty than he both in means and parentage, although not in strength, reason or courage.
            Hardly had they ended these words, when by the light of the stars they saw the <span class="body">arms</span> of the squadron and its captain of whom they had spoken, and now
            being joined all together, they lodged by force in various houses of the village.
            The
            pilgrim, curious to learn (as are all those who travel in foreign countries), mingled
            himself amongst the soldiers, who in no way disliked his company but instead invited
            him
            to supper; after which (the floor serving them for beds) they entertained one the
            other
            with discourse, until the slow dawn then at the end of February became daybreak. Now
            that
            they knew the pilgrim's history, and he being desirous to learn from them their own
            turbulent narrative, his features and comprehension being pleasing to them, one among
            them
            named Ramond told it in this manner:<br /></p>
         
         
         <div class="floating">
            
            
            <p class="narrative">The History of <span class="persName">Doricles</span></p>
            
            
            
            <p class="prose">In this famous city, which with a wonderful greatness opposeth
               <span class="placeName">Italy</span>, and astonisheth <span class="placeName">Africa</span>, there
               was born a lady of noble parentage, who having been a firebrand unto her country,
               had no small conformity with Greek <span class="persName">Helen</span>. Her name was
               <span class="persName">Florinda</span>, her beauty heavenly and her spirit divine, and she
               having attained unto years fit for marriage, two knights equal in youth, greatness
               of means and nobleness of blood did seek her <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, with like hope but unlike favour. <span class="emotion" title="noun">Love</span>, natural inclination, a sympathy of manners or an influence of the
               stars did constrain <span class="persName">Florinda</span> to <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>
               <span class="persName">Doricles</span> and hate <span class="persName">Filander</span>, who to shorten
               his way between hope and possession, and to prevent his rival, demanded her in
               marriage of her parents, who would willingly have given the respect which they might
               unto the intercessor and his merits, had they not found that
               <span class="persName">Florinda</span> felt differently on gaining knowledge of the husband
               which they propounded to her. They <span class="emotion" title="verb">loved</span> her
               tenderly and would not constrain her with rigour, but speaking frankly to
               <span class="persName">Filander</span>, told him that she would not agree to it, although
               they had persuaded her as masters, and commanded as parents.
               <span class="persName">Filander</span> augmenting his <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> by her dislike, found out that the <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> which <span class="persName">Florinda</span> bore for
               <span class="persName">Doricles</span> was the cause of the <span class="emotion" title="noun">disdain</span> she bore him. The idea of revenge came to him, and he formed a
               resolution to remove from the world the obstacle of his design, notwithstanding the
               scandals and evils that so brutal an enterprise might bring. He armed himself with
               such company as he thought good (as he was not unprovided with friends nor wanted
               servants) at such times as he thought he might find <span class="persName">Doricles</span> at
               his mistress's door, or in the street by her house. But his rival, dubious of his
               plans, always went well accompanied and better armed, as one who did not think that
               he could have a better friend than his sword. Having caused a ladder to be brought
               upon the eve of a feast unto her garden wall, by that means to speak with her, it
               happened that <span class="persName">Filander</span> coming into that street, and performing
               his usual office of spy, heard <span class="persName">Florinda</span> speak to
               <span class="persName">Doricles</span>, and saw her give him a nosegay of jasmine which she
               had in her <span class="body">hand</span>, with embracings more insupportable to him than
               favourable to <span class="persName">Doricles</span>. He charged those which kept the gate,
               and began with them a cruel combat: <span class="persName">Doricles</span> comes down, and
               searching Philander in the midst of his enemies, wounds him and puts him to flight:
               for a favoured lover is as a gambler who wins, and in all hazards is always master
               of the fortunes of his adversary. <span class="persName">Doricles</span> goes away victorious
               out of the street, while <span class="persName">Filander</span>'s <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> (which had turned to disdain) became by this encounter a
               mortal <span class="emotion" title="noun">hatred</span>. Then either side increased their
               bands; the fire of their <span class="emotion" title="noun">anger</span> kindled all their
               parents; and although they every day spoke together as if they had no quarrel, they
               failed not to fight every night when they met. In this scandal
               <span class="persName">Doricles</span> lost the <span class="emotion" title="verb">enjoying</span>
               of his mistress, <span class="persName">Filander</span> her favour, she her renown and their
               parents their honour. Time increased the <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> of
               the one, while the other's hatred increased his <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> of revenge, and of the small <span class="emotion" title="noun">pleasure</span> which the two lovers had, <span class="persName">Filander</span> had the
               least, it seeming better to him in this business to rely upon his industry for the
               effecting of that which his strength would be wanting. Having then learned that
               <span class="persName">Florinda</span> was to take her <span class="emotion" title="noun">pleasure</span> at sea in a bark, he hid two or three days before a brigantine in a
               creek not far from the shore, in which he appareled himself like a Turk, with some
               other of his friends (for accomplices in <span class="emotion" title="adj">amorous</span>
               enterprises are seldom wanting) and with necessary rowers attended his mistress: the
               Meuxin, which is the tower where the watch of <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span> is
               kept, having discovered that no enemies sailed in all the sea. In the meantime the
               contented <span class="persName">Florinda</span> with her companions was not gone from the
               shore a league when the counterfeit frigate hoisted sail, and beating the water with
               her oars, overtook her bark, the mariners whereof looking for nothing less than such
               a surprise, could not resolve either to fly or to defend themselves; but
               contrariwise (as the <span class="emotion" title="adj">fearful</span> bird seeing the <span class="emotion" title="adj">proud</span> merlin come fiercely stooping upon her, is
               accustomed to attend her with couched wings) acknowledging by the Turkish sails, the
               power of their enemies which were upon them, and quitted their oars; and <span class="emotion" title="noun">fear</span> (which with a cold shivering ran through all
               their veins) gave them no time to discern their deceit. Finally they boarded them,
               and two or three of the disguised Turks leaping into the bark ravished away the new
               <span class="persName">Helen</span>, who was carried into the brigantine and found herself
               in the <span class="body">arms</span> of <span class="persName">Filander</span>. The counterfeit
               words of these pirates, who called him Murat Rais, made those who remained free in
               the bark believe that he was the author of this robbery, and seeing that they took
               nothing but <span class="persName">Florinda</span>, they returned again to
               <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>, recounting the disgrace in every street and
               place where they came, with more cries and tears than words, which coming to the<span class="body">ears</span>of her parents, caused more <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span> in them then can be told, principally in her <span class="emotion" title="adj">sorrowful</span> mother, who bewailed her loss with a <span class="emotion" title="noun">passion</span> more befitting her sex than a generous courage. Mounted
               scouts in vain spurred up and down the coast, but <span class="persName">Filander</span> (who
               had brought <span class="persName">Florinda</span> into a private garden house, having taken
               away his turban and his Turkish disguise) declared unto her, that the incomparable
               force of his <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> had constrained him to have
               recourse to this deviousness, and did enjoy her beauty with assurance, although she
               took heaven, the trees and the fountains to witness the violence which was used on
               her.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">Of no less consideration was <span class="persName">Doricles</span>' pain, who full of
               mortal <span class="emotion" title="noun">sorrow</span>, was a thousand times by the sea's
               side ready to imitate the despair of those nymphs which saw Europa ravished;
               nevertheless, and as well to oblige unto him his mistress's parents, and to satisfy
               himself, he bought a ship of an Aragonese, which had brought in wheat, and loading
               it with silks, velvets and other merc<span class="body">hand</span>ise gave his sails to
               the wind, turning his prow toward Argiere, Sali, Morat,
               <span class="placeName">Fuchel</span>, <span class="placeName">Mami</span>,
               <span class="placeName">Xafer</span>, and other pirate haunts;
               <span class="persName">Doricles</span> enquired amongst them of his mistress, and of as
               many others as he knew did rob upon the coast of <span class="placeName">Spain</span>. But
               when he met with none who could tell him news of her, whom his rival <span class="emotion" title="verb">enjoyed</span> with such <span class="emotion" title="noun">pleasure</span>, he went to <span class="placeName">Constantinople</span>, and from thence
               unto <span class="placeName">Cairo</span>, and having run along the coast of the kingdoms of
               <span class="placeName">Fez</span>, <span class="placeName">Morocco</span>,
               <span class="placeName">Tarndan</span>, and <span class="placeName">Tafilet</span>, <span class="emotion" title="adj">despairing</span> of ever finding her, whom he had so long
               time, and so vainly sought, changed his merc<span class="body">hand</span>ise into
               Christian slaves and returning into <span class="placeName">Spain</span>, disembarked at
               <span class="placeName">Ceuta</span>. While the deceived <span class="persName">Doricles</span> did
               thus run along the coast of <span class="placeName">Africa</span>, a servant of
               <span class="persName">Filander</span>, were it either out of some displeasure which he had
               taken, or out of <span class="emotion" title="noun">envy</span> of his <span class="emotion" title="noun">happiness</span>, revealed all the proceeding unto the Justice of
               <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>, who in the night following besieged the garden
               house, with main force, and took <span class="persName">Filander</span> then when he least
               expected it. The news and admiration, which his subtility and surprise caused in the
               city, moved the citizens confusedly to see him pass through the streets; through the
               midst of whom he was borne to prison, and the <span class="emotion" title="adj">sorrowful</span> maid (already made a woman against her will) was rendered unto her
               parents; the sentence was mortal, the opinion common, the approbation general, and
               the process short. The scaffold was ready, <span class="persName">Filander</span> disposed
               himself to die, and made it appear that he had the courage of a knight, and the soul
               of a Christian; nevertheless the Viceroy and the Bishop, interposing their
               authority, assembled the parents, and having mollified the nearest, dissuaded
               <span class="persName">Filander</span>'s death, in respect of the honour which they might
               gain by his life. So of two evils choosing the least, they had more care to the
               reparation of their honour, than to the contentment of revenge; thus they changed
               the mourning which was already provided for <span class="persName">Filander</span> into
               nuptial habits, and the scaffold into a bed, where <span class="persName">Florinda</span> was
               given him in lawful marriage: but the same day that they joined <span class="body">hands</span> with the <span class="emotion" title="noun">contentment</span> and rejoicing
               of all the world, <span class="persName">Doricles</span> entered into the city, and unlooked
               for appeared at the <span class="body">head</span> of two hundred men, whom he had drawn
               out of captivity, upon whose casques did shine in silver broidery the <span class="body">arms</span> of <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span> and their restorer; his
               word was I <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> the King. The sight and entry of
               this heroic citizen was exceedingly agreeable and dear unto the Barcelonians; but
               the insupportable news of his rival's marriage with his mistress was no sooner come
               unto <span class="persName">Doricles</span>' ears, but all the city in <span class="body">arms</span> were divided into factions, and contrary parties. This suspended the
               marriage for some days, during which time it was remonstrated unto
               <span class="persName">Doricles</span>, that he could not marry
               <span class="persName">Florinda</span> without infamy. He answered that what he could not
               have, ought not to be given to <span class="persName">Filander</span>, it being in no way
               reasonable that this deceiver should gain by fraud what he had lost by so much
               travail; and there was no other means to accord him, but that
               <span class="persName">Florinda</span> should retire into a monastery. This distressed her
               parents who were already <span class="emotion" title="adj">contented</span> with the
               satisfaction of their honour, and the alliance of their son in law, whose parents
               offered unto <span class="persName">Doricles</span> a beautiful sister of
               <span class="persName">Filander</span> in marriage; but he unwilling thereunto, demanded
               justice against <span class="persName">Filander</span> for his crime, offering that after he
               should be beheaded he would marry <span class="persName">Florinda</span> as widow unto a
               knight. This last offer was in principle agreed unto by
               <span class="persName">Filander</span>'s and <span class="persName">Florinda</span>'s parents, but
               when <span class="persName">Doricles</span> thought that <span class="persName">Filander</span> had
               been led to prison, and from thence to death, he was given to understand how he was
               pardoned, and the marriage consummated. If his <span class="emotion" title="noun">sorrow</span> were great it may be known by the effects, seeing it is now twenty
               years since, from these <span class="placeName">Pyrennean mountains</span> which divide
               <span class="placeName">France</span> from <span class="placeName">Spain</span>, he hath lived as
               an outlaw, robbed, pillaged and ruined all that he finds, neither kingdoms being
               able to take any revenge. He was one and twenty years old when he came from
               <span class="placeName">Africa</span>: he is now forty one: a strong man, vigorous of his
               person, which is much fortified by his austere and wild life. And that may be
               believed of him, which was said of <span class="persName">Hercules</span>, that without doubt
               he had three lives, for if he had had but one, it had been a miracle that he had not
               lost it by so many wounds.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">This day about sunrise he came down to see what noise this was, which the night
               before had sounded from the sea unto the woods, and he with about ten of us which
               followed him having found some boards which the sea had cast up, upon one of which
               was seated a young man in habit of a pilgrim like thyself, pale, in a trance, all
               drenched in water, his <span class="body">hair</span> full of dirt and sand, and to
               conclude, evil accommodated with this tempest. He commanded us to carry him to that
               place where the rest of his men were, and as well to dry him as to get him breath,
               which he had almost lost, we endeavoured to unclothe him, but he refusing to be seen
               or to be touched by us, it made our captain suspect that he was not a man, for
               although he enforced himself to appear so, yet his actions showed the clean
               contrary; when as preventing the <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> which the
               captain had to be cleared of his sex, this pilgrim of whom I tell thee (taking him
               aside) confessed that she was a woman, who came in this habit from
               <span class="placeName">Italy</span>, with her husband; in which voyage, they had suffered
               shipwreck upon this shore: and in saying this, <span class="emotion" title="noun">shame</span> and <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> to defend herself
               brought colour into her <span class="body">face</span>, and valour into her <span class="body">heart</span>; with one, she appeared perfectly fair, and with the other
               extremely hardy: Nevertheless her beauty being more powerful to hurt others, than
               her strength to defend herself, hath vanquished <span class="persName">Doricles</span>' mind,
               who with sweet and courteous words persuaded her to rest this day in his company,
               during which time her <span class="body">face</span> hath never been without tears. In
               the meantime he commanded, after sunset, that his supper and his bed should be
               provided in one of those villages, but we instantly heard that some charge of money
               which was to be carried to <span class="placeName">Genoa</span>, should come this way, and
               having waited for them until midnight, we were without both supper and lodging: for
               this cause we sent two of our companions before, who are they which found you
               together with him who conducted us hither; <span class="persName">Doricles</span> is now with
               this pilgrim; I cannot tell thee whether he hath gained her or no, nor whether the
               bed had made a peace between two minds so absolutely differing: but certain it is
               that they are now lodged together.<br /></p>
            
            
            
         </div>
         
         
         <p class="prose">The soldiers easily perceived that the pilgrim hearing this story, bathed his <span class="body">face</span> with his tears, and with <span class="emotion" title="adj">sad</span> and
            violent sighings endeavoured to pierce heaven: they desiring the cause, he remaining
            a
            long time silent, and they still pressing him; in the end he began to cry out: Oh
            <span class="emotion" title="adj">miserable</span> wretch that I am, I have lost my honour, my
            glory is destroyed, my hope is dead, by the <span class="body">hands</span> and weakness of a
            woman. Oh that ever the sea pardoned my life, since that with so much <span class="emotion" title="noun">pity</span>, it reserved thine, to the end that my <span class="body">eyes</span>
            might be witnesses (after so many labours and dangers) of such an offence. Well did
            the
            soldiers know that this was the man whom the pilgrim respected, and the true north
            star
            unto which she turned the needle of her affection: but they endeavouring to comfort
            him,
            so much increased his <span class="emotion" title="noun">fury</span>, that drawing forth his
            sword out of his pilgrim's staff, the outside whereof served as a scabbard, he ran
            enraged
            out of the house unto the house where the captain lay, and there gave such blows upon
            the
            door, and such loud cries, that the captain thinking he had been assailed by the Justice
            or by the inhabitants of that place, leaped out of his bed in his shirt, his pistol
            in his
            <span class="body">hand</span>, and opening the door asked Who was there? A wretched man,
            answered the pilgrim with an incredible fierceness, and one from whom thou hast taken
            his
            honour, with this vile woman which thou dost possess. <span class="persName">Doricles</span>
            discharged his pistol and the pilgrim turning his <span class="body">body</span>, the bullet
            lit in his<span class="body">arm</span> All the company ran thither at the noise, and the
            valiant Catalonian disposed himself to strike quicker than the lightning come out
            of
            thunder sent by Jove against the giants, when the <span class="emotion" title="adj">miserable</span> pilgrim woman, embracing him with prayers, begged the pilgrim's life,
            saying unto <span class="persName">Doricles</span>, that this man was he whom she did only
            acknowledge for her master, and on the other side assuring her <span class="emotion" title="adj">desperate</span> husband that she had not transgressed against her honour,
            neither in deed, word nor thought; because his prayers had not vanquished her, and
            his
            threats could never. I do not know if it ought to be believed of a woman: the history
            commendeth her chastity, and I do religiously believe the virtue of this sex so much
            esteemed by me, and so greatly held in account all my life. <span class="persName">Doricles</span>
            would willingly that the pilgrim should have been <span class="emotion" title="adj">contented</span> with his life, which he would leave him, and that he should have gone
            away without the woman, but the incensed Castilian defying him to a single combat,
            began
            to defame him, and provoke him in such manner, that he commanded his soldiers to hang
            him
            up at the next tree of the mountain: hardly was the word out of the captain's <span class="body">mouth</span>, when the pilgrim found himself carried out of the village by
            those barbarous fellows, and upon his way towards the wood where he should be branched
            up.
            Finding himself then at the place of execution and in the presence of an inevitable
            death,
            he entreated them with tears that they would let him recommend his soul to him that
            was
            the author thereof; which being permitted unto him, he drew out of his bosom an image
            of
            the blessed Virgin; which holding up, with his <span class="body">eyes</span> and his <span class="body">hands</span> to heaven, he began his prayers devoutly, having the match of one
            of their pieces about his <span class="body">neck</span> near unto him who tied it to a bough
            of a great oak, only waiting for the end of his devotions: nevertheless even as he
            fastened the last knot, the fair morning <span class="emotion" title="noun">rejoicing</span> the
            world with new light, clearly discovered the amiable colour of his <span class="body">face</span>.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">Who will believe that in the space of one night so many fortunes should happen to
            one
            man, if it were not known that things are written to be marked, and that evils do
            seldom
            come alone, seeing that the evils which happen in one night to one unfortunate man,
            do
            surpass all the prosperity which can happen to a fortunate man in all his life? The
            soldiers seeing the honest and grave countenance of this pilgrim, his youth and his
            innocence, and being otherwise mollified with his prayers; or having their <span class="body">hearts</span> secretly touched by the <span class="body">hands</span> of God, for he who
            hardened Pharaoh's <span class="body">heart</span> can mollify others, they resolved to let him
            live, not willing to be more cruel than the sea, which the day before had cast him
            upon
            land from drowning; and thinking it was an infamous cruelty, that he who had been
            spared
            by things without sense, should be destroyed by them who ought to have reason. The
            pilgrim
            gave them thanks for their liberality, and referring their reward unto heaven, entreated
            them that if by chance, this woman which he had left, did persevere in the firmness
            of her
            speech, they should tell her that she should find him at <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>:
            this said, he took his way towards the city, and the soldiers towards the village.
            But the
            feigned news of his death which they were constrained to deliver unto
            <span class="persName">Doricles</span>, so much deprived the <span class="emotion" title="adj">sorrowful</span> pilgrim woman of sense (whom he had already thrust out of his chamber,
            being vexed with her cries) that she remained a long time as dead, and when as she
            was
            come again unto herself, she did and said so many <span class="emotion" title="adj">pitiful</span> things, that these fierce men most accustomed to shed blood, did now shed
            tears. So that the captain <span class="emotion" title="adj">despairing</span> of ever being able
            to pacify her, and thinking that the beginnings of extreme <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span> do easily pass to a frenzy, commanded that she should be carried upon the
            great highway; where the <span class="emotion" title="adj">miserable</span> woman was left,
            drowning herself in tears, and murdering her <span class="body">face</span> with her <span class="body">hands</span>, she made herself look with great deformity: from thence
            following the way by the seaside she went to <span class="placeName">Valencia</span>.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">The pilgrim in the meantime was at <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>, having stayed two
            days, to view the goodly strong walls of the city; the third day as he was beholding
            the
            Viceroy's palace, this fisherman, whose voice had so unhappily drawn him from the
            cabins
            of the other fishermen, and as a deceitful hyena had called him to bring his life
            into
            such danger, knew him, and demanded of him if he were not the thief, which entertained
            him
            the other night with words, until his companions came and entering by force into the
            houses of the village, had robbed them and pillaged them? It is true answered the
            pilgrim,
            that I am he who by the sound of thy voice came out of the cabins of men of thy
            profession, but not he who came with the robbers which you speak of: upon this they
            contested one against the other, insomuch that the people ran to the noise; and as
            to be
            pursued with hue and cry, there needs no more cause but to be a stranger, so all the
            world
            believing in the natural Catalonian's words, the poor pilgrim was impetuously carried
            away
            by the people, and as a robber put into prison.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">The infamous rabble who for crimes great or small are accustomed to possess these
            places,
            which are like so many true representations of Hell, put him into a dark corner worse
            than
            the worst sink of <span class="placeName">Constantinople</span>, where it is impossible to recite
            the blows they gave him, and the injuries they said unto him: because having no metal
            about him but the bullet, which <span class="persName">Doricles</span> shot into him the night of
            his misfortune, he had not wherewith to pay his garnish or entrance, nor ability to
            find
            better means to appease them.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">Night victorious over human cares, imposing rest unto their labours and their thoughts,
            and reducing their actions to a deep silence came amongst these barbarous people,
            yet the
            <span class="emotion" title="adj">miserable</span> stranger only not so much as closing his <span class="body">eyes</span>: he felt not the <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span> of his
            wound, not the infamy of his imprisonment, all that which troubled him, and all that
            which
            he <span class="emotion" title="verb">feared</span>, was the pilgrim woman's losing of her
            honour, which wrought so with him, that whilst others slept in this confusion, without
            that the want of beds, the importunity of many noisome creatures, which run up and
            down in
            the prison, the <span class="emotion" title="noun">fear</span> of judgement to come, nor the
            present misfortune could wake them; our pilgrim only is awake, complaining against
            heaven,
            the sea, and his cruel fortune which had preserved his life, then, when he had no
            feeling
            of death, to make him suffer it now in a state so sensible.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">At the length the sun with a countenance full of <span class="emotion" title="noun">shame</span>
            and as if he had been constrained, shone through the thick bars of the prison windows,
            showing in the pale colour of his beams, that he <span class="emotion" title="verb">feared</span>
            he should be kept there, when the pleasant blows of the jailer, and the sweet noise
            which
            his keys made in the strong locks, awaked from their forgetfulness those unto whom
            the <span class="emotion" title="noun">fear</span> of punishment for their faults could work no
            remembrance: but the pilgrim was not waked, because he was not asleep; he came out
            amongst
            the rest nevertheless to give thanks to the day, for having passed over so <span class="emotion" title="adj">miserable</span> a night. There began this <span class="emotion" title="adj">miserable</span><span class="body">body</span>to move his parts, going many leagues
            in a little space: prayers importuned some, care wearied others; necessity called
            out
            here, hunger sighed there, and Liberty was wished for everywhere: the laws called
            upon
            execution, ministers upon punishment, and favour importuned for delay; those who had
            wherewith went out by the air, others not having wherewith could not find the door;
            the
            confusion of voices, the unquietness of the judge, the coming in of some, the going
            out of
            others, and the noise of fetters, made in this discordant instrument a <span class="emotion" title="adj">fearful</span> striving.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">In this time, a knight, who for the nobleness of his blood, and the antiquity of his
            imprisonment, was generally respected as the master, cast his <span class="body">eyes</span>
            upon the pilgrim, and considering his deep melancholy, his habit and his person, incited
            by his good countenance and aspect, (for there is no letter of favour which worketh
            greater effects in all necessities) called him to a little alley which answered to
            the
            door of his chamber, and asked his name, his country, and the cause of his imprisonment.
            The pilgrim recited unto him the success which you have heard, beginning his life,
            from
            the time that the sea gave it him, by casting him upon the shore not far from the
            walls of
            <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>. The knight wondered at it, and collecting from his
            reasons, and the manner of his speech, his understanding and his gentleness, took
            such
            affection unto him, that he placed him in his chamber: where having restored his weak
            forces, with conserves which he had, he made him reveal his<span class="body">arm</span> and he
            himself healed the wound with medicines and words, which he had learned being a soldier;
            for if herbs and stones have this virtue, wherefore should it be wanting to holy
            words?<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">The <span class="emotion" title="adj">contented</span> pilgrim afterwards turning his <span class="body">eyes</span> round about the chamber, saw written upon the walls with a coal
            according to the ancient manner of prisoners, certain hieroglyphic verses, at the
            sight
            whereof, he knew that he who had written them was not ignorant. Over the picture of
            a
            young man, which had the chief place, was written this verse from Virgil:<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">in somnis ecce ante oculos maestissimus <span class="persName">Hector</span><br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">After that was painted a <span class="body">heart</span> with wings, which flew after death
            with the letter of <span class="persName">Aeneas</span>, sending the<span class="body">body</span>of his
            friend to the great Evander.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">mortuus Pallante<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">Near unto that was figured <span class="persName">Prometheus</span>, or

            <p class="narrative">The History of <span class="persName">Mireno</span></p>
            
            
            
            <p class="prose">In a little town not far from this great city, there was a gentleman named
               <span class="persName">Telemachus</span> married with a fair lady, not so chaste as the
               Roman <span class="persName">Lucretia</span> although she carried her name; the report was,
               that this marriage was made against her wishes, and it is likely to be true, as by
               the effects it was afterwards witnessed: her melancholy increased, her beauty and
               clothes neglected, did show a languishment, as roses, when the radical moisture of
               their boughs decreases. <span class="persName">Telemachus</span> did force himself to divert
               her from this sad kind of neglect, least it might seem unto some which should see
               her, that this <span class="emotion" title="noun">sadness</span> proceeded from his
               default, for oftentimes innocent husbands are accused for their wives' evil
               conditions. He apparelled her richly, allowed her to solace and recreate herself at
               sea, and carried her to see the choicest gardens. And this being not sufficient he
               opened his house to all good company. Amongst the young knights which did ordinarily
               frequent and converse with them, there was one called <span class="persName">Mireno</span>,
               so much my friend, that if death had not set a difference between us, I could not
               have been persuaded (he being alive) to discern which of us two had been myself.
               This man cast his <span class="body">eyes</span> (until this time busied in the
               consideration of another's beauty) upon <span class="persName">Telemachus</span>' fair wife;
               who looking upon him more earnestly than upon any other, had (it may be) incited
               him: for although it be said that <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> can pierce
               as a spirit, into the most close and secret places: yet I do think it impossible,
               that any man should <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, if he be not at the
               first obliged thereunto by some little hope. He concealed from me the beginning of
               his thought: for<span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>is always borne discreetly,
               and dumb as a child. But the same sweetness of its conversation doth so quickly
               teach it to speak, that like a prisoner at the bar he oftentimes cast himself away
               by his own <span class="body">tongue</span>. So after he saw himself admitted in
               <span class="persName">Lucretia</span>'s <span class="body">eyes</span> (an evident index that
               he was already in her soul) not being able to suffer the glory of that whereof he
               easily endured the pain; he made unto me a great discourse of his fortune, or to say
               truer, of his folly; which could not have been hurtful unto him, if he had followed
               my advice as well as he asked it. But it is ordinary, especially with those who are
               in <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, to ask counsel, then when as for nothing
               in the world they would forbear to do that which they have in their mind. There was
               no history, either divine or human, which was within my knowledge and to the
               purpose, that I did not lay before him, exaggerating the evils which did proceed
               from like enterprises. But <span class="persName">Mireno</span> who had already firmly
               determined to follow his purpose, and thinking that I was not apt for his design,
               by
               little and little, forbore to visit me. Quickly did he forbear to accompany me in
               walking: we went no more by day to public conversations, nor by night to private;
               A
               notable error in the condition of men, whose <span class="emotion" title="verb">loves</span> and friendships are kept by flattery, and lost by truth. I did bear
               <span class="persName">Mireno</span>'s absence with great impatience, and he had no feeling
               of his living without me; because <span class="persName">Lucretia</span> being now his whole
               soul, could not suffer that he should have another <span class="persName">Mireno</span>:
               having thus shaken me off, communicated his business with a third, who was so common
               a friend unto us both, that when I wanted <span class="persName">Mireno</span>, or
               <span class="persName">Mireno</span> wanted me, we did seek one the other at his house.
               This man was not so considerate as I was, contrariwise there was no kind of danger,
               into which he would not precipitate himself to <span class="emotion" title="noun">pleasure</span> his friend; such friends are like powder on festival days, which to
               <span class="emotion" title="verb">rejoice</span> others spendeth itself. This made me
               disguise myself to follow them in the night; and one time above the rest, when I had
               more patience, and they less consideration than the ordinary, I saw how they set a
               ladder to a window of a tower, which revealed a spacious prospect towards the sea,
               over a garden of <span class="persName">Telemachus</span>: I stayed to the end, not to
               discover what they did, but to see if I could serve in any stead in the importance
               of this danger, and my <span class="body">heart</span> did not deceive me, although
               <span class="persName">Mireno</span> who was within it did deceive me. For after the first
               sleep, then when as with less force he vanquisheth the cares of a master of a
               family, I heard a noise, and presently I saw <span class="persName">Mireno</span> coming down
               the ladder, and <span class="persName">Aurelio</span> (for so was he called with whom he was
               accompanied) receiving him in his <span class="body">arms</span>, and persuading him to
               fly: hardly were they out of the street, when a servant loosing the ladder let it
               fall. I ran to the fall thereof, and as well as I could gathering it up, stepped
               behind a corner, from whence I espied <span class="persName">Telemachus</span> in his shirt,
               having his sword naked in one <span class="body">hand</span>, and a candle in the other:
               and looking out from the window of the tower if he could discern anything upon the
               ground, of that which he had heard: I crept softly to the gate; and hearkening what
               was said in this family where there was this alarm, I understood that the disgrace
               of our two lovers, was taken to be the industry of robbers. In this they were not
               deceived, for those are no small thieves, who steal good name and rob away honour:
               I
               returned a little more <span class="emotion" title="adj">contented</span> to my house, but
               slept but badly, in this care. The morning being come I sent for
               <span class="persName">Mireno</span>, with whom having discoursed of divers matters, I
               asked what news of <span class="persName">Lucretia</span>? He told me he did not speak with
               her: for all wicked secrets do for the most part conceal themselves from true
               friends. I said then unto him, that I wondered he would dissemble a thing so known;
               <span class="persName">Telemachus</span> her husband being come unto my house, to tell me
               that he had heard him within his; that looking out of a window of a tower, he had
               seen him go down by a ladder: <span class="persName">Mireno</span>
               <span class="emotion" title="adj">astonished</span> and wondering at my revelation,
               confessed unto me what had passed, and how <span class="persName">Lucretia</span> having
               yielded to his letters, messages, and services had made him master of her liberty,
               yielding unto him the treasure which was so fiercely guarded by
               <span class="persName">Telemachus</span>' hundred <span class="body">eyes</span>. Which was the
               reason why I placed this hieroglyphic of <span class="persName">Argus</span> and
               <span class="persName">Mercury</span>, with the epigram:<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">Subtle <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> deceiveth jealousy.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">He proceeded to tell me that when <span class="persName">Telemachus</span> was asleep, they
               talked together in a garden, into which he entered by a ladder made of cords, which
               <span class="persName">Aurelio</span> kept, unto whom only he had imparted this secret,
               having found me so averse from succouring him. I asked what he had done with the
               ladder? He told me that from the leaving of that proceeded
               <span class="persName">Telemachus</span>' advertisement. I told him that
               <span class="persName">Telemachus</span> knew nothing, neither had the ladder served as an
               occasion to discover anything unto him: and letting him see the service which I had
               done him, I did begin to conjure him, that he would abandon the perilous success
               which he ought to expect from the pursuit of this design, seeing that
               <span class="persName">Telemachus</span> at the least had notice that his wife was not by
               his side when there was noise in the lodging. So that he promised me, he would not
               go any more thither, and the more to divert him from going thither, he resolved to
               absent himself from <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>. I confirmed him in this
               resolution; because that truly there is nothing which so much eclipseth the <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> of lovers, as an interposed distance of
               place between them; yet it was not needful, because by the time
               <span class="persName">Mireno</span> disposed himself to depart,
               <span class="persName">Telemachus</span> had already changed his dwelling from this city
               unto the little place where he was married; and this was a memorable observation,
               <span class="persName">Mireno</span> losing the repeated view of his
               <span class="persName">Lucretia</span>, lost her also out of his thought, and confirmed his
               <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> better than ever to
               <span class="persName">Erisila</span>, (she was that other lady whom I in the beginning of
               my discourse I said he had loved) who again <span class="emotion" title="verb">loved</span>
               him better and with more pleasure than before, because that <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> which succeedeth after <span class="emotion" title="noun">jealousy</span> is more violent. Besides, the amiable parts which were in
               <span class="persName">Mireno</span>, who was of a goodly stature, of great spirit, and an
               illustrious blood, of a free condition, amiable both on horseback, and on <span class="body">foot</span>, and renowned beyond all of his age, for all military
               exercise; as for his <span class="body">face</span>, behold this picture, wherein I
               assure you, the painter was no flatterer; I keep it here for my comfort, although
               it
               be always present in my soul, as you may judge by the words written:<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">Before my <span class="body">eyes</span> in a dream, <span class="emotion" title="adj">sad</span>
               <span class="persName">Hector</span> did appear.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">Because truly his image did never abandon my sight, but either sleeping or waking
               he was represented to my <span class="body">eyes</span>: in effect we fell into our old
               inwardness; but in the midst of this peace, the wife of
               <span class="persName">Telemachus</span> had so much power over him, that vanquished with
               her prayers, he brought her again to <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>, where she was
               no sooner seen by <span class="persName">Mireno</span>, but the ancient flames of his <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, blowing away the ashes into the wind,
               revealed themselves more lively: and I fearing what might happen by this coming back
               of <span class="persName">Lucretia</span>, persuaded <span class="persName">Mireno</span> to marry. He
               himself finding that it was the honorablest, the easiest and the safest way to
               distance himself from these loves, entreated me to find out some worthy subject, who
               might set a bound unto his affections: I propounded many who I thought were of his
               quality, although not of his merit; but it was with him as with those who buy
               without <span class="emotion" title="noun">pleasure</span>, and do not <span class="emotion" title="adj">content</span> themselves with any price; for some are too high, others
               too low: these black, those pale; one lean, the other too fat; this was too fine,
               another too sluttish: in short, seeing that he liked none of those, and would not
               marry, I left him, for I saw that <span class="persName">Lucretia</span> had more power with
               him than all the others together. They then began to see one another again, for in
               these good works, mediators are seldom wanting: <span class="persName">Erisila</span> who was
               <span class="emotion" title="adverb">passionately</span> in <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> with <span class="persName">Mireno</span>, began to discern in him a coldness
               and a carelessness in seeing her, and that he did divert himself by other pleasures.
               She (in this suspicion, which may be called a true jealousy) began to observe and
               follow him; so that without spoiling much, she knew, if not all that passed, at the
               least what was the subject which ravished away her <span class="persName">Mireno</span>.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">Who will believe so extraordinary a conceit as I shall tell you? Truly he only, who
               doth know how much the spirit of a woman is disposed (especially if she is in <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>) to any kind of industry and subtility:
               <span class="persName">Erisila</span> never left seeking occasion that
               <span class="persName">Telemachus</span> should see her, until in the end
               <span class="persName">Telemachus</span> did behold her, and in viewing
               <span class="persName">Erisila</span>, he saw in her a brave disposition of a woman, who
               looked upon him with fair and sweet <span class="body">eyes</span>; for when they will
               deceive, they make their <span class="body">eyes</span> snares, and their sweetnesses
               baits: <span class="persName">Telemachus</span> yielded himself (although he <span class="emotion" title="verb">loved</span>
               <span class="persName">Lucretia</span>) forced by the <span class="body">eyes</span> and beauty of
               <span class="persName">Erisila</span>, which did so much the more provoke him, by how much
               she <span class="emotion" title="verb">desired</span> to deceive him: he began to come to
               her house, and she to feign a great deal of <span class="emotion" title="noun">passion</span>, <span class="persName">Mireno</span> giving them leisure enough, as he did
               not frequent her house as he was accustomed. Finally their affection came to the
               point that <span class="persName">Erisila</span> desired. Then she said unto him one day (as
               if she had not known him to be married, which he dissembled also) that she had seen
               him enter into one <span class="persName">Lucretia</span>'s house, whereat she had conceived
               great jealousy. <span class="persName">Telemachus</span> smiling, began to appease her
               saying, that it was without any design that he had entered into this house (whereof
               indeed he was master) and as she began to witness a more feeling <span class="emotion" title="noun">sorrow</span>, accompanied with false tears; he began to remonstrate that
               <span class="persName">Lucretia</span> was virtuous and well born; with a great many other
               commendations of her chastity, and of <span class="persName">Telemachus</span> her husband's
               care (commending himself). And some are of the opinion that self-commending is not
               unbeseeming, when it importeth the good opinion of another man.
               <span class="persName">Erisila</span> then finding a good occasion for her wicked design,
               told him that <span class="persName">Lucretia</span>'s husband might be a gallant man, yet
               nevertheless she knew that <span class="persName">Lucretia</span> did not forbear to make <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> unto a knight of the city; and she was afraid
               that she might as well <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> him as the other:
               because whatsoever woman she be, she doth easily suffer herself to be won, after the
               first lightness: <span class="persName">Telemachus</span> who began to wax so pale that it
               was easily seen in his <span class="body">face</span>, what interest he had in this
               discourse; entreated her to discover who was this knight: but she feigning to be <span class="emotion" title="adj">jealous</span> of him, whom she did endeavour to make so
               <span class="emotion" title="adj">jealous</span>, enforceth her complaints, persuading
               him that she was troubled with that <span class="emotion" title="noun">jealousy</span>
               which indeed she had raised in him. In short, <span class="persName">Erisila</span> was
               unwilling to name who it was; <span class="persName">Telemachus</span> suddenly stepped to
               her, and drawing his dagger, setting it to her <span class="body">throat</span> made her
               utter the name of <span class="persName">Mireno</span>, a person whom he knew better then
               she: with this <span class="persName">Telemachus</span> went away, confessing it was true
               that he had <span class="emotion" title="verb">loved</span>
               <span class="persName">Lucretia</span>, not knowing she had another lover; but now from this
               time forward he would <span class="emotion" title="verb">hate</span> her, and would settle
               all his affection upon her, in confirmation of which, he gave her a chain of gold,
               and a diamond.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">By this means, <span class="persName">Erisila</span> thought that the husband would keep his
               house, and that <span class="persName">Mireno</span> (by this means barred from seeing
               <span class="persName">Lucretia</span>) would come to visit her as he was accustomed. But
               the knight, whom it concerned to wipe away this spot from his honour by the blood
               of
               he who had offended him, seeing it was now no longer time to keep that which was
               lost, feigning a few days after to go to <span class="placeName">Montserrat</span>, gave a
               beginning to his revenge, and an end unto my life. The two lovers were not so
               besotted, nor I such a fool, that we did not think (although we were ignorant of
               <span class="persName">Erisila</span>'s malice) that this absence might be feigned; having
               had so many examples in the world; wherefore we sent our faithful friend
               <span class="persName">Aurelio</span> secretly after him. But the advised
               <span class="persName">Telemachus</span>, who knew well that he was not to deceive fools,
               feigning that he went to <span class="placeName">Valencia</span>, returned when he was
               halfway, and hid himself in <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">Now <span class="persName">Mireno</span> could not spend the night so assured with
               <span class="persName">Lucretia</span> but that I kept the door, although he did entreat me
               not to do it; God knoweth how many nights I passed without <span class="emotion" title="noun">pleasure</span>; for my <span class="body">heart</span> did always tell me
               that their two lives did run a dangerous fortune. But
               <span class="persName">Telemachus</span> the third night after entering by a secret door
               into the garden (as I spoke of unto you) without being heard or seen by any person,
               with only one servant with him, who carried a halberd, came unto the chamber where
               his steps were heard, and out of which <span class="persName">Mireno</span> came to meet him,
               very evil provided of <span class="body">arms</span> to defend himself, not that I doubt
               he would not have well defended himself, half asleep and naked as he was, with his
               sword alone which he had in his <span class="body">hand</span>: If his adversary, who was
               accommodated with more advantageous <span class="body">arms</span>, had not overthrown
               him dead to the ground with an arquebus shot: the report of the piece, made me judge
               that such a salutation at that time of the night, was rather a condemnation, than
               anything else: wherefore endeavouring to break open the doors, I waked the
               neighbours, some of whom running thither with their <span class="body">arms</span>, and
               having helped me to overthrow the doors, we entered in. Already had
               <span class="persName">Telemachus</span> broken into his cabin, where
               <span class="persName">Lucretia</span> was hid, and dragging her from thence, not far from
               the place where <span class="persName">Mireno</span> lay, he thrust his sword into her, so
               that as we arrived, her breath went away with a last Jesu. And as he had already
               killed <span class="persName">Mireno</span>, methought <span class="persName">Scaliger</span>'s verse,
               which is under this picture was not unapt:<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">Was it not enough to kill and vanquish men?<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">I had not as yet seen <span class="persName">Mireno</span>, and searching him with mine <span class="body">eyes</span> all about the room, I saw him lying dead: thou may see in
               the tears which now flow from my <span class="body">eyes</span>, what was then my <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span>, I do not know what I did, yet seeking for
               <span class="persName">Telemachus</span>, I did excuse him for the care of defending
               himself; and from justifying so bloody an execution: for having met <span class="body">face</span> to <span class="body">face</span>, I thrust at him, with which thrust, he
               accompanied their two lives, which he had extinguished. By this time the house was
               beset by those whom the Justice had raised, who apprehended as many as they found,
               and me especially, for having killed <span class="persName">Telemachus</span> without cause,
               although according to the laws of the world there was but too much cause, and here
               they put me where thou now see me, and where I have lived this five years, desiring
               death, as thou may see by this winged <span class="body">heart</span> of mine flying
               after this image of dead <span class="persName">Mireno</span>; with these words out of
               Virgil:<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">My Pallas dead, I bide alive by force.<br /></p>

               words which I have made for <span class="persName">Lucretia</span>'s tomb:<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">Here lieth <span class="persName">Lucretia</span>, less chaste than the Roman, but more
               fair: Tarquin did not force her, but <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>; and
               although she died for her infidelity, <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, who
               was the cause, has the power to excuse her.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">So the faire <span class="persName">Lucretia</span> remained in mortal rest, and her name,
               in my imagination, is not worthy of blame: for having been overcome by the excellent
               parts of her lover, and by that unchangeable force which<span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>ever useth against great and free courages.<br /></p>

            <span class="persName">Everard</span> (so was the knight called that made this discourse)
            favoured his affairs: for his innocence could not gain him his liberty, nor good opinion,
            which he did deserve; so powerful was his only habit, to work in the judges an evil
            conceit of his person; yet <span class="persName">Doricles</span> (captain of those robbers) being
            pardoned, and received again into the city's favour; the pilgrim was also absolved,

            months imprisonment, which without the help of <span class="persName">Everard</span> had been
            insupportable. They took their leaves one of another, with a thousand loving embraces,
            and
            <span class="persName">Everard</span> having further obliged him with some money, he resolved to

         <p class="prose">By a straight way, between thick trees and shady did the pilgrim go towards
            <span class="placeName">Montserrat</span>, who turning his <span class="body">head</span> at a noise
            which he heard behind at his <span class="body">back</span>, he saw two young men with palmer’s
            staves, whose fair faces and blond <span class="body">hair</span> showed them to be either
            Germans or Flemings. He saluted them, and <span class="emotion" title="adj">joyful</span> of so
            good company, he imposed silence unto a thousand <span class="emotion" title="adj">sad</span>
            thoughts, which solitariness had brought into his memory. Travelling together, they
            began
            to discourse of diverse matters, with which they easily and with <span class="emotion" title="noun">pleasure</span> passed away the craggy, and uneven way of the mountain, until
            they came unto a fountain, which bubbling into a valley, made a gentle harmony. So
            that as
            it were invited by the sweet noise and the fresh shade, they sat down upon the rushes
            which grew by the brook’s side, and admired the sweet complaints of the nightingale.
            One
            of the Germans, which shewed a good nature embellished with learning, began to discourse
            of Filomela’s <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, saying that now she would
            recompense with her infinite notes, for all the time that she had been dumb after
            Terreus
            had cut out her <span class="body">tongue</span>. The Spaniard replied that Martial had uttered
            the same conceit, and the German rejoicing to find in him more capacity than in common
            persons (for it is an insupportable labour to travel with an ignorant man) rose from
            the
            place where he sat, and embracing him with a great deal of contentment, after many
            other
            discourses, Let us go, said he, to adore the blessed Virgin. In this image so much
            renowned, through all the world, we cannot make a more holy voyage, nor I in better
            company than thine: let us go said the Spaniard by this path, which seemeth to me
            to be
            much the shorter, although a little steeper, for the most part of the way.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">This being said, they took their way towards the abbey, which they discovered shortly
            after, built upon the side of a sharp mountain, and under a great rock, which did
            seem to
            threaten it with ruin.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">When they were entered, with <span class="emotion" title="noun">devotion</span> and humility,
            casting their <span class="body">eyes</span> upon tapestries of <span class="placeName">France</span>,
            <span class="placeName">Germany</span>, and almost all the world: they were <span class="emotion" title="adj">astonished</span>, to see the walls decked with so many excellent paintings,
            histories, and accompanied with a thousand several kinds of offerings, which with
            an
            admirable correspondence did stir up and astonish the senses altogether. There did
            they
            pour forth their prayers and their tears, and after they had seen and been informed
            of all
            that was considerable in the monastery, the day having lost her beauty by the sun’s
            absence; they retired altogether until the morning shining through the eastern gates
            gave
            them knowledge of the new day’s approach. Then they resolved to visit the divers
            habitations of the hermits which lived in these mountains, and being come unto the
            seventh
            hermitage, they found a young man of an agreeable countenance and a goodly presence,
            whose
            long and well combed <span class="body">hair</span> gave a reverent majesty unto his aspect.
            This man stayed them dinner, and after their repast, being entreated by the pilgrims
            to
            tell them what <span class="emotion" title="noun">devotion</span> had confined him into these
            solitary mountains, he related the history of his life, in this manner:<br /></p>
         
         
         <div class="floating">
            
            
            <p class="narrative">The History of <span class="persName">Aurelia</span></p>
            
            
            <p class="prose">Amongst all the things which in the course of my life I have seen and marked, I
               might peradventure tell you some one, which might better <span class="emotion" title="adj">content</span> you. But thinking that one cannot better persuade than by
               the example of himself, I will therefore tell you a story which is drawn from my
               youth, and from the twentieth year of my age, written by my misfortune and imprinted
               in my memory, seeing that the renewing can do me no damage, and may bring you
               profit. This short tyranny, the bane of youth, the illusion of the sight, the prison
               of the soul, and the darkener of the sense, which is called Beauty, and which heaven
               seemeth to give women for our mischief: blinded so my <span class="body">eyes</span> at
               the first knowledge, which they had in the world, that my spirit did not live so
               much in myself, as in her whom I <span class="emotion" title="verb">loved</span>, nor found
               more rest out of her sight, than things do out of their centre; because that as the
               fire always sendeth the flames thereof to its proper sphere, so my <span class="body">heart</span> addressed its <span class="emotion" title="verb">desires</span> to her
               beauty.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">Now as this <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> was not platonic, I will not
               dispute whether it were honest, profitable, or delightful; let it satisfy that it
               which is the cause of so much evil, seemed unto me, the greatest and sovereignest
               good in the world. This subject of my misfortunes was called
               <span class="persName">Aurelia</span>, free in her customs of that kind of life which
               <span class="persName">Plautus</span> and <span class="persName">Terence</span> describe in their
               fables; and of whom <span class="persName">Aulus</span> saith excellently well; that a
               courtesan is a vessel full of holes, which can contain nothing. She was fair in all
               perfection, of a quick and hardy spirit and of a reasonable good nature, a woman (to
               be short) unto whom experience in the world had brought a great deal of knowledge.
               It cost me little to possess her, because that these kind of women (clean contrary
               unto other women, who forced by the<span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>of a man,
               do honestly yield unto his merits) trusting to their ch<span class="body">arms</span> and
               unto the gentleness of usage, are <span class="emotion" title="adj">passionate</span> with
               men more when they are <span class="emotion" title="verb">enjoyed</span> than when they are
               pretended. I was not vexed at the first with the conversation of the young men, who
               at any hour howsoever extraordinary were never wanting in her house, because the
               favours which she did me, and the little which they cost me made me live much <span class="emotion" title="adj">contented</span>, especially seeing myself preferred before
               others of better means and merits then myself; when I went to see her, they gave me
               place, and departed courteously, leaving me alone with her.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">These my visitations were not agreeable unto her servants, because they thought
               that thereby this rabble of youth was scattered, which brought them profit. And that
               if <span class="persName">Aurelia</span> should fall in <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> with me, my quality being not capable to sustain her expense, she must
               spend out of her own means, from whence would inevitably follow a necessity of
               living more regularly, which they would by no means hear of; and of this were they
               not much deceived, for in a small time <span class="persName">Aurelia</span>, who had
               ravished so many others, was taken herself in my <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, and made captive to my will, which made true one part of this <span class="emotion" title="noun">fear</span>, by shortening the revenues of her house, to
               lengthen the reins of her <span class="emotion" title="noun">pleasure</span>. Not that all
               the charge of the house fell upon her; for I <span class="emotion" title="adj">miserable</span> man, tormenting my parents, and importuning my friends, did run to
               the preservation of this love, which almost always depended on money.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">The life which we led (we loving one another tenderly, and having in our power the
               liberty of <span class="emotion" title="verb">enjoying</span> may easily be judged by my
               youth, and by <span class="persName">Aurelia</span>’s, who was then about twenty years old.
               The house seemed too strait for our <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, and
               searching solitary fields, we made the sight of open heaven witness of our follies.
               Our life was a blind imitation of the nature of beasts, we communicated our secrets
               to trees, which did not see, as if the leaves had not been so many clear <span class="body">eyes</span>, and a thousand <span class="emotion" title="adj">amorous</span>
               delights to the dumb fountains, which might well have troubled the purity of their
               waters, I cannot think how in so little a way as there was between my house and
               hers. It remained 5 years space before I knew that I was arrived there, being
               certain, that in 3 years space of that time, the famous <span class="persName">English
                  Drake</span> passed the <span class="placeName">Strait of Magellan</span> and
               compassed the world about. If in all this time, the loyalty which she swore unto me
               were broken or no, I am not able to say, nor yet forbear to believe, because it
               seems almost a thing impossible for such women from their custom, to keep themselves
               to an orderly life.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">At the end of these five years, I saw myself at the end of my means, and although
               I
               was more <span class="emotion" title="adj">amorous</span> than in the beginning, yet
               <span class="persName">Aurelia</span> did suffer herself to be vanquished by the
               obligations of another, who had more power than my services: I say obligations,
               because I cannot believe that only <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> can bind
               one unto so strange a change. One night <span class="persName">Aurelia</span> having seen me
               retire myself unto my bed, she had received <span class="persName">Feliciano</span> into hers
               (so was the knight called.) I stirred with a profound <span class="emotion" title="noun">jealousy</span>, rose up out of my bed, and went to her house, where the door was
               shut against me: and the servants answered me from above out at a high window,
               feigning that they were gone to bed, to make me rather to retire unto my own house.
               But my extreme<span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>which would not at that time,
               have relied upon my <span class="body">eyes</span>, and feared to be betrayed by my
               thoughts, made me cry aloud, that somebody should open the door, so that my voice
               came unto <span class="persName">Aurelia</span>'s ears. And <span class="persName">Feliciano</span>
               making show of a valiant-lover, began to clothe himself, promising to chastise my
               boldness with his sword, and by his only presence to cure my folly; but the cunning
               <span class="persName">Circe</span>, who knew well whatsoever good or bad success came unto
               me, it would rebound unto her <span class="emotion" title="noun">shame</span>, hindered him
               with her <span class="body">arms</span> and diverted him with her tears, although there
               was no great need: for the bravest do unwillingly<span class="body">arm</span>themselves
               when they are once naked; and to come out of a house into the street had been a
               manifest and <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span> rashness.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose"><span class="persName">Aurelia</span> so prevailing in that manner, wherein others of her
               kind are wont to prevail; and making <span class="persName">Feliciano</span> believe that I
               should be her husband, and that if I did perceive him she should lose me, persuaded
               him half unclothed and in the midst of January, that he would go onto the highest
               roof of the house. Onto which he being gone, I was let into the house, where I found
               <span class="persName">Aurelia</span> in bed making so many complaints of my liberty, and
               of the scandal which I gave the neighbours, that instead of being <span class="emotion" title="adj">angry</span>, it behove me to appease her, where (after some time spent)
               she in complaining of me, and I in asking pardon for my <span class="emotion" title="noun">jealousy</span>, and for the <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span>
               which I had to surprise her in that infidelity which I did distrust: I possessed the
               absent man’s place, which was still warm, serving for a proof of my ignorance and
               blockishness. Morning brought again the sun, and the sun the day, yet neither of
               them was sufficient to make me see my folly (so evil doth a lover discern of his own
               acts) I rose contented, and although I entered last, yet I went sooner away then
               <span class="persName">Feliciano</span>.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">In the meantime <span class="persName">Menander</span> who had for the space of some years
               been <span class="persName">Feliciano</span>'s mistress, grew extremely <span class="emotion" title="adj">jealous</span>, and hearing of this trick which
               <span class="persName">Aurelia</span> had put upon him, could not forbear speaking of it,
               mocking him with the cold night which he had endured, and that he had suffered me,
               who never had any intent to marry her, to possess that place by her side which he
               had lost: <span class="persName">Feliciano</span> assured her that
               <span class="persName">Aurelia</span> (preferring his <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, before the obligations, wherein for so many years she was bound unto
               me) did rather abuse me than him; and that whensoever she or any other would afford
               him the like courtesy, he would willingly suffer one evil night to have so many
               good: and for proof of what he said, he gave her a key, whereof I was wont to be
               master, which I was made believe was lost. <span class="persName">Menander</span> dissembled
               her thoughts, but so soon as she met me again, she told me all the circumstances,
               and with all gave me the key; having which I needed no other witnesses of the truth,
               nor other instrument to open the door. I then resolved to revenge myself of
               <span class="persName">Aurelia</span> in leaving her, and of
               <span class="persName">Feliciano</span>, in serving <span class="persName">Menander</span>, from
               whose<span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>I presumed he had not freed himself,
               and if he had been free yet I knew he must needs be <span class="emotion" title="verb">grieved</span> that I should <span class="emotion" title="verb">enjoy</span> her whom he
               loved in everybody’s opinion. I found <span class="persName">Menander</span> willingly
               disposed, for our thoughts were alike, and our injury alike, and we might well serve
               to revenge one the other. She then feigned to <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> me, and I paid her in the like counterfeiting.
               <span class="persName">Aurelia</span> was advertised, and grew desperate, and
               <span class="persName">Feliciano</span> no less <span class="emotion" title="adj">enraged</span>,
               sought me to kill me. Behold how jealousies and neglects do reveal the truths which
               are in the centre of our <span class="body">hearts</span>.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose"><span class="persName">Aurelia</span> found me sooner than <span class="persName">Feliciano</span>
               did, as she who therein hazarded least: and staying me began in <span class="emotion" title="noun">fury</span> and in threatenings, yet ended in prayers and in tears. But
               upon so fresh an injury, I was rather confirmed in my neglect (seeing her yield unto
               my <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>) than any way moved with her <span class="emotion" title="noun">passion</span>. Finally, having changed my first affection
               into <span class="emotion" title="noun">hatred</span>, (always insupportable to a woman who
               hath been well beloved) <span class="persName">Aurelia</span> began to pursue me, and
               although that the city of my birth and abode doth not yield for greatness to above
               two or three in all <span class="placeName">Spain</span>, yet could not I find any lodging
               wherein she did not clamour me, any friend whom she did not revolt from me, any
               secret which she did not publish, nor any danger whereinto she did not endeavour to
               throw me. So that oppressed with these pursuits, and seeing myself reduced to the
               contenting of her, after a thousand contrary deliberations, I resolved to take upon
               me a religious habit, and to prevail by his protection, in whose <span class="body">hands</span> and <span class="body">feet</span> God hath imprinted the marks of our
               reparation.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">But oh! the supreme force of a <span class="emotion" title="verb">despised</span>
               <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, as from the holy choir of the monastery,
               from the midst of the altars and images of the saints, the tears of
               <span class="persName">Aurelia</span> drew me again; and then I followed her, with more
               liberty and less <span class="emotion" title="noun">shame</span> then before, leaving the
               habit whereof I was not worthy, and neglecting the spiritual treasure which I did
               then <span class="emotion" title="verb">enjoy</span>, to follow the infamous life which I
               had formerly led, so much power hath the capital enemy of our souls. Our<span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>began fresher than ever, with the general
               scandal of those who knew us, the <span class="emotion" title="noun">hatred</span> of our
               parents and the <span class="emotion" title="noun">detestation</span> of all our friends,
               which within a small time brought me to such terms that I thought <span class="emotion" title="noun">sorrow</span> would have killed me. The infamy wherein we lived and the
               <span class="emotion" title="noun">fear</span> of justice did oblige us to depart the
               city, and selling that small remainder of goods which we had left, laden with a
               number of evils, we passed into <span class="placeName">Italy</span>; from whence I went
               (for some time) to serve the catholic king in <span class="placeName">Flanders</span>, and
               the <span class="persName">Duke of Savoy</span> in <span class="placeName">Piedmont</span>, returning
               always to <span class="placeName">Naples</span> where I had left her. The last time I put to
               sea with her in my company (intending after the <span class="placeName">Flanders</span> wars
               to return into <span class="placeName">Spain</span>) where in a violent tempest (which
               heaven for the quiet of our souls) sent us in the gulf of
               <span class="placeName">Narbonne</span>; in the last point of life, and when we were past
               hope of escaping, we vowed ourselves to a religious life with such earnestness of
               tears, that afterwards the storm ceasing and we landing, she entered into the
               Monastery of the Conception; and I underwent this habit wherein you now see me,
               where after some years of probation this cell was given me.<br /></p>
            
            
            
         </div>
         
         
         <p class="prose">Here <span class="persName">Tirsis the Hermit</span> of this <span class="emotion" title="adj">happy</span> abode stayed his discourse, and our pilgrims judging that it was too late to
            pass further, and it being necessary to descend into the lodging which within this
            holy
            house is given freely to strangers, they went unto the monastery, discoursing upon
            the
            hermit’s relation, determining the next day to go to the uttermost hermitage, which
            under
            the title of St Jerome, crowneth the <span class="body">head</span> of the mountain.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">But the misfortunes of our pilgrim, which had slept for some time, began to wake with
            more violence; for in the house where these strangers had lodged there were missing
            some
            jewels, with a maidservant of the house, and the Germans amongst others were pursued
            by
            the Justice, although innocent, because it was affirmed by some that this servant
            enamoured of their beauties had run away with them.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">All nations have their epithets, which being once received by the world can never
            be
            lost. The Scythians are called cruel, the Italians religious, the French noble, the
            Dutch
            industrious, the Persians faithless, the Turks lascivious, the Parthians curious,
            the
            Burgundians fierce, the Britains hardy, the Egyptians valiant, the Lorraines gentle,
            the
            Spaniards arrogant and the Germans beautiful. And this was the cause for which it
            was
            thought that the maid being seduced by them had run away with them.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">Now the Germans were easily taken, but the pilgrim <span class="emotion" title="adj">desperate</span> through his late long imprisonment which he had suffered in
            <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>, and out of the little justice which he as a stranger
            could expect, seeing them come unto him, stood upon his defence, and flourishing his
            palmer’s staff, (with which he was very skilful) left two of them lying upon the ground
            wounded, and virtuously freed himself from the <span class="body">hands</span> of the others,
            who remained <span class="emotion" title="adj">astonished</span> at his valour. Between
            <span class="placeName">Tortosa</span> and <span class="placeName">Castellón</span> there stretcheth
            forth a great hill, wherewith the sea of that coast is bounded, along the coast of
            the
            vale of Sego and of the Kingdom of <span class="placeName">Valencia</span>: where the Moors of
            <span class="placeName">Algiers</span> and Salé do land out of their galleys, when they are not
            perceived by the watch, and hiding themselves amongst the hollow places of these hills,
            do
            rob not only the fishermen but all such as pass that way. And sometimes when they
            are many
            of them together, they do rob away whole villages together; in this vale, they being
            guided by renegades, and those betrayed again by the Moors: there one dark night did
            the
            pilgrim lie (weary with his journey which he had taken out of the way) obliged thereunto
            by the <span class="emotion" title="noun">fear</span> which he had of pursuit. And being asleep
            after many long and grievous imaginations of his lost <span class="emotion" title="noun">happiness</span>, which he did believe to be still in the <span class="body">hands</span> of
            <span class="persName">Doricles</span>, the roaring of the sea (the waves whereof breaking
            against the rocks make a horrible noise) awaked him. He heard near unto him the voices
            of
            some Moors, who having <span class="emotion" title="adverb">joyfully</span>supped upon the land,
            were talking of their robberies. He who sleeping upon the ground in the field, at
            his
            waking, findeth himself near unto a venomous snake, doth not so soon lose his colour,
            as
            doth our <span class="emotion" title="adj">fearful</span>
            <span class="persName">Pilgrim</span>, hearing the Moors so near him, whose <span class="body">hands</span> he did think it impossible to escape. Yet relying upon his judgement in a
            matter wherein he thought his strength would not prevail, stole from them by gentle
            sliding upon the ground, making his <span class="body">hands</span> perform the office of his
            <span class="body">feet</span> until he had attained the top of the hill, where finding that
            the Moors had heard him, he began to cry with a loud voice: Here valiant knights here,
            this is our day: behold the Moors before you, and as prey in your <span class="body">hands</span>, whom you have with such pains and diligence endeavoured to overtake. Hardly
            had he courageously uttered these words, when as the Moors (like frogs who at the
            noise of
            passengers leap from the bank sides into the quiet waters of the lake) ran with all
            the
            speed they could to the sea to get aboard their boat, with which they easily got to
            their
            galley.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">Full of admiration was the pilgrim, to see how <span class="emotion" title="adverb">happily</span> his resolution had succeeded, when from a tree which was near unto him he
            heard a voice, which said: Ah knight, help me for the mother of God’s sake. His valiant
            courage which was never <span class="emotion" title="adj">astonished</span> with any kind of
            danger or misfortune, guided by the voice unto the tree, where he had heard him, saw
            a man
            tied thereunto, of whom having asked his name, he was answered, that he was a Catalonian
            knight, whom the Moors (after they had killed two of his servants) had taken upon
            the
            coast road of <span class="placeName">Valencia</span>. The pilgrim having unbound him, and both of
            them departing from the sea, took their way to <span class="placeName">Almenara</span>, and
            through the valley beautified with orange trees, travelled towards
            <span class="placeName">Faura</span>. Already had the morning strewed pearls upon flowers, who
            putting their <span class="body">head</span>s forth of the boughs, did seem to salute the day,
            when both the discourse, and <span class="body">face</span> of the knight, did show unto the
            pilgrim that this was <span class="persName">Everard</span>, he who (when he was prisoner at
            <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>) had obliged the pilgrim for his liberty; both their
            joys, their embraces and their tears were as admirable as the success which you have
            heard, from whence is recollected, how agreeable unto heaven is the good which is
            done
            unto strangers; signified by the ancient philosophers in <span class="persName">Deucalion</span>
            and <span class="persName">Pyrrha</span>, who for having lodged <span class="persName">Jupiter</span>,
            were made restorers of the world; and contrarily, <span class="persName">Diomedes</span> devouring
            his guests with his horses, he was in the end himself devoured by them.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">The pilgrim demanded of <span class="persName">Everard</span> how he had gotten his liberty, and
            he told him that with the help of some friends he had broken prison, and escaped away
            by
            the post of <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>; from whence he might well have gone for
            <span class="placeName">Italy</span>, but being unwilling to be a runaway from his own country,
            he was resolved to go to the Court to have his cause judged, whither he was going
            with
            that intention, when he fell into this ambush of the Moors. He then demanded of him,
            if he
            knew <span class="persName">Doricles</span> and being answered that he was his kinsman, the pilgrim
            sighed many times, without telling the cause, although he were much importuned by
            <span class="persName">Everard</span>, unto whom he only said, he had a young brother in his
            company who had quitted him to follow <span class="persName">Doricles</span>;
            <span class="persName">Everard</span> who understood something of the secrets (suspecting that
            this was some woman, who had been stolen away by the robbers upon the shore of
            <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>) assured him that he knew all the servants which
            <span class="persName">Doricles</span> had in his house, and that there was not one Castellan
            amongst them.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">In such and like words, which drew infinite sighs and tears from the pilgrim, they
            arrived at the ancient <span class="placeName">Sagunto</span>, (where at this day are remaining,
            the most famous works of the Roman period of any that are in <span class="placeName">Spain</span>)
            and from thence they went to the city of <span class="placeName">Valencia</span>, entering by the
            royal bridge over the Turia, which river the Moors call Guadalaviar: and passing by
            the
            famous Towers of Serranos, they lodged at a knight’s house, who was friend unto
            <span class="persName">Everard</span>, and of the family of the Mercaderos. There they remained
            this night, finishing the relation of their fortunes, until the sun rising called
            them
            from their rest, especially <span class="persName">Everard</span>, who carried with a strong desire
            of finishing his intended journey, departed with <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span>
            from the company of the pilgrim, whom he left no less <span class="emotion" title="adj">sorrowful</span>, in this flourishing city.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">There he spent a few days in beholding the <span class="emotion" title="adj">proud</span>
            buildings wherewith it was embellished: and in the end he visited the hospital where
            mad
            folks are with more care and convenience looked unto and kept, than in any city in
            all
            <span class="placeName">Spain</span>: there beholding the several humours of these <span class="emotion" title="adj">miserable</span> people, he (I say) who lately was likely to have
            lost his own wits, saw amongst those who were least <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span>,
            sit down at the table (at which they did altogether eat) a young fool and very beautiful,
            whose flaxen <span class="body">hair</span> was longer than men do ordinarily wear in
            <span class="placeName">Spain</span>. All the blood in this pilgrim’s<span class="body">body</span>came into his <span class="body">face</span>, and went suddenly back again, out of
            the remembrance which this mad creature brought unto him of his mistress, whom he
            could
            not well know, as well because he could not comprehend in his mind by what means she
            had
            been reduced to this distraction; and less, how to this place, as also through her
            evil
            usage in that place, and her sickness, she did differ from the idea which he had of
            her
            countenance in his mind. Nevertheless, as she beheld him with her <span class="body">eyes</span> full of admiration, he was confirmed in his first thought, and letting fall
            some tears, he said unto her in a low voice (least the keeper who had brought them
            to the
            table should hear them) do ye know me? To whom this woman (never known to be so in
            that
            place) who had seen him carried unto the oaks of the mountain, where Captain
            <span class="persName">Doricles</span> had commanded his soldiers to hang him, for whose death
            she had shed so many tears, and sighed out so many complaints, that the violence of
            her
            <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span> had troubled her understanding; and yet also
            doubting of his life, though she did see him; tremblingly answered, that she was wont
            to
            know him. Already was this pilgrim, by the voice, by the <span class="emotion" title="noun">fearfulness</span>, and by the tears assured that this mad <span class="body">body</span> was
            the master of all her wits; and <span class="emotion" title="verb">fearing</span> lest he might
            make some demonstration of his inward <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span>, whereunto
            by the sight of this so great misfortune he was obliged; he demanded softly of her,
            how
            and by what means she was come unto this <span class="emotion" title="adj">miserable</span>
            estate? The grief I took (answered she) thinking upon your death, as soon as the Captain
            had commanded that you should be hanged. Not without having offended me, replied the
            pilgrim, a thing which I never expected from your constancy, although far greater
            occasion
            had been offered. The losing of my honour (said she) must be out of these two respects,
            either of force or for pleasure: if out of <span class="emotion" title="noun">pleasure</span>, I
            had now no cause to bewail myself; nor if it were by force means to bring remedy,
            and less
            means had I in losing of my wits. And that it is true, that the very thought I had
            of your
            death was the cause of my madness, let this satisfy you, to see that I recover them,
            in
            having you alive. Fair <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, answered the pilgrim, am not I a
            miserable man, in having been the cause of so much evil by my misfortunes? There is
            nothing, dear <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> (replied <span class="persName">Nisa</span> in
            weeping) deserves this name that hath been suffered for your occasion, and for so
            cruel a
            feeling as the report of your death brought to me. And if I were permitted to embrace
            you
            here according unto my <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span>, the recompense would be
            as great as the travels, which I do bewail only in regard they were no more, since
            that,
            according to their multitude, they would augment the glory of my suffering. It was
            not in
            vain, answered <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, (for the History names him from
            henceforward) that my hope made me <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> to live, only
            that I might see you, for I was assured that in the glory of beholding you, all <span class="emotion" title="noun">jealousy</span> would be wiped away, that might any way allay my
            <span class="emotion" title="noun">joy</span>. And if the <span class="body">eyes</span> of those
            who look upon us, did not better see, then their understandings do know, you should
            before
            this have found that your <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> of embracing was most
            agreeable to me. To this said <span class="persName">Nisa</span> (whose name hitherto we have hid,
            as also <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’), because that travailing in this habit amongst so
            many dangers (I durst not tell their country nor their name) I will make my <span class="emotion" title="noun">passion</span> serve as a remedy. What passion? answered
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>. Every time, said she when my <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span> deprives me of my reason, they tell me that I cry aloud, those
            words which I will now say to thee, in embracing thee. And then she said these words:
            O my
            spouse, is it possible that my <span class="body">eyes</span> do behold thee? Is it not thou,
            who died in the mountains of <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>, by the evil <span class="body">hands</span> of <span class="persName">Doricles</span>’ barbarous soldiers? Blessed be the hour
            wherein I see the news is false. In speaking this, <span class="persName">Nisa</span> fell about
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’ <span class="body">neck</span>, <span class="emotion" title="adverb">amorously</span> embracing him, whose overwhelming delight was only
            interrupted by the presence of the assistants.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">When the man (who had the charge of appeasing the <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span>
            folks’ <span class="emotion" title="noun">fury</span> saw this deportment in
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, he began to give her rude words and sharp blows. Let him
            alone said <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, for I am his countryman and his wife’s kinsman,
            and do not wonder that this sight of me, doth cause in him this <span class="emotion" title="noun">sorrow</span>. Whatsoever you are, answered this barbarous fellow, it skills
            not, here are neither complements nor visitations. And the token of this man’s <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span> fit in coming upon him, is to call his husband, with
            such or the like words. But if I pacify this, his <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span>
            fit said <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, to what end doth your chastisement serve? And how
            will you appease it, said the other, is not this an evident token of his madness,
            that he
            calls you his spouse, and takes you for a woman? You are ignorant of his humour, and
            of
            the trouble he gives us, although he does not appear to be above nineteen year of
            age. I
            know all this well, answered <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>. Nevertheless let me speak to
            him, for I do assure you that myself alone can appease him; and as it is a good work,
            from
            anybody who hath a sickness to take away the pain, for some time, though it return
            again;
            so in madness, it is a good work to bring to pass, that he who hath lost his wits
            should
            recover them again though it were but for one hour.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">Yet neither this reason, nor many other, served him to any purpose, for the officers
            had
            already put manacles upon <span class="persName">Nisa</span>'s <span class="body">hands</span>; and the
            master did rigorously pull her to the cage, although she had no need of this remedy,
            nor
            any other, but the sight of <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>. But as those who are
            accustomed to lie, are seldom believed, although they say the truth: so in him who
            is <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span>, it is accounted a token of greater madness, to seem
            wise. Thus <span class="persName">Nisa</span> was had away to strait imprisonment, and
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> standing ashamed, <span class="emotion" title="verb">fearing</span> that everyone knew what was privy only to himself, beheld her with
            abundance of tears; a thousand times he was about to let go the reins of his passion,
            which his understanding held in, and to be <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span> in
            reason, believing that if he were <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span>, the chastisement
            of his madness should be to remain with <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, which was the greatest
            good he could hope for. And to begin his design, he offered (against the laws of this
            house) to break the gates of the prison, and see her by force: but hardly had he made
            any
            demonstration thereof, when the porters with the <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span>
            servitors, (such as having recovered their wits, do serve the others) fell upon him,
            and
            beating him cruelly, flung him into the street, where (as the fish whereof
            <span class="persName">Aristotle</span> speaks which being drawn out of the water, frames a
            humane voice and dies) he fetched a great sigh and fell upon the ground exhausted.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">The sun was declined low toward the west, colouring with gold and purple that part
            of the
            horizon, when <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> returning out of his misery found himself in
            the <span class="body">arms</span> of a young man, who having compassion of his <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span>, encouraged him to recover life.
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> looking steadfastly upon him, with heavy <span class="emotion" title="noun">sadness</span>, demanded where he was? The young man told him,
            that he was at the door of the hospital, where the <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span>
            folks were kept. And how is it, replied <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, that I am not
            within? Because (said the other) thou appearest to be more diseased in<span class="body">body</span>then in the passions of thy mind. Thou judgest by the countenance (said
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>) but if thou hadst seen my <span class="body">heart</span>,
            thou wouldst rather judge that my evil proceeded from my spirit: true it is, that
            the<span class="body">body</span>feeleth also the pains of the mind. What kind of evil is thine,
            answered the young man, being so near the place, where evils of wounded minds are
            cured?
            For if thou art not within the Hospital, thou desirest (as it seemeth) to be in, seeing
            thou dost not deny thy evil; and thou confessest, that it proceedeth from thy mind,
            the
            passions whereof are not far from falling into that infirmity which is cured in this
            place. The evil which I have (said <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>) hath a remedy in this
            house, and my misfortune is such, that <span class="emotion" title="adj">despairing</span> to
            cure me, they have flung me out. Thou canst have no such evil, answered the young
            man, but
            there is an antidote to be found for it. Incurable<span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>(said <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> groaning out a sigh) unto which all the
            medicines and herbs of physic are improfitable. What is not <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> but to be cured, answered the other? And are <span class="persName">Avicenna</span>’s
            seven remedies of no force, and not true? Of those said <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>,
            and at the tales which <span class="persName">Pliny</span> writeth, my <span class="emotion" title="noun">passion</span> worketh; I only allow of his counsel, who adviseth chiefly to
            marry; but the disposition of my fortune, and the rigorous influence of my stars,
            not only
            do not suffer me, but make it to me almost impossible. And although hope sometime
            promiseth it to me, yet I find that it is truly as <span class="persName">Plato</span> calleth it:
            the waking man’s dream. <span class="emotion" title="noun">Love</span>, then (said the young man)
            is the cause of this habit which thou wearest, and of thy pilgrimage. It is so (said
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>) and by that thou may know the quality of my evil, and
            the difficulty of my cure. Oh, said the young man pitifully sighing, what a grievous
            story, dost thou renew in me. A history like unto mine? said
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>. If not, said the other, yet at the least of <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>. By thy faith (then said
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>) dost thou love? I not only <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, said the other, but am also more <span class="emotion" title="adj">unhappy</span>
            than thou thinkest, for a stranger and a pilgrim, and no less <span class="emotion" title="verb">outraged</span> by fortune. Tell me then, said <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>,
            (in looking earnestly upon him) thy name and of what country thou art; for in all
            the
            years of my banishment, I could never find any man so <span class="emotion" title="adverb">miserably</span> persecuted as myself: and in this, I have more occasion than all men to
            bewail my destinies. A Christian, said the stranger, ought never to bewail the destinies,
            nor think that good or evil fortune depend on them: although many ancient philosophers
            have believed that there is a kind of devil, and certain imaginary women which they
            call
            <span class="persName">Parquae</span>, which give the spirit into the creature at the birth, an
            opinion worthy rather of laughter, than belief; It being most certain, that this name
            Destiny, is only to be attributed to the decree of God, who truly seeth and knoweth
            all
            things before they be, and the ordering of them cannot depend on anything but of him.
            I
            know well, said <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, that the Poets have called these
            <span class="persName">Parquae</span> Destiny, and the Philosophers, especially the Stoics, have
            believed that it is an order or disposition of second causes, as from the planets
            under
            the influence of which we are born, which rule and determine all the inferior good
            and
            evil effects which do happen to man: so said <span class="persName">Ptolemy</span>,
            <span class="persName">Democritus</span>, <span class="persName">Chrysippus</span> and
            <span class="persName">Epicurus</span>, who also ascribe to Destiny, all the inclinations, the
            vices and the virtues, the desires and passions even unto the actions and thoughts,
            which
            some have endeavoured to prove by the authority of <span class="persName">Boetius</span>, who says
            that the order of destiny moves the heavens, and the stars temper the elements, and
            tie
            human actions to their causes by a most indissoluble knot.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">But leaving apart a matter of so long a discourse, from whence is sprung the error
            of the
            Priscillianists, who believe that the soul and the<span class="body">body</span>are necessarily
            subject to the stars, and many other errors which succeed this first; I <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> thou shouldst know, that I speak according to custom, which
            willeth that this name Destiny, and other Christian idioms, be taken for misfortune,
            believing that nevertheless, God in his divine providence speaks by Destiny as men
            express
            the conceptions of their minds by words. Thy <span class="body">face</span> (said the young
            man) promiseth no less, than what I have heard come from thy <span class="body">mouth</span>;
            for thy presence and aspect is an index of thy nobleness, as thy <span class="body">tongue</span> is of knowledge: which worketh in me a great pleasure, and <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> to tell thee my name, my country, quality and my

            <p class="prose">The city of <span class="placeName">Toledo</span>, in the <span class="body">heart</span> of
               <span class="placeName">Spain</span>; strong by situation, noble by antiquity, famous for
               the preservation of the Christian faith ever since the time of the Goths, generous
               both in learning and <span class="body">arms</span>, having a temperate heaven and a
               fertile Earth. Environed with the famous <span class="placeName">river Tagus</span>, which
               is itself also begirt with a high but pleasant hill: it is the place where my now
               living parents were born, as also myself (although my ancestors in former times came
               from those parts of the <span class="placeName">Asturias</span> which are called
               <span class="placeName">Santillana</span>, the ancient title of the house of
               <span class="persName">Mendoza</span>) there was I brought up in my more tender years. But
               when my parents thought I was capable of learning, they sent me to the University
               of
               <span class="placeName">Salamanca</span>, with such company as was fit for a man of my
               place, to the end that besides the Latin <span class="body">tongue</span> which I knew
               already, I might study the knowledge of the law. Here I am constrained to make a
               long digression, because that of the history of another, depends the foundation of
               mine. My father had other children; <span class="persName">Lisard</span> his eldest son, who
               was in <span class="placeName">Flanders</span> with the <span class="persName">Archduke
                  Albert</span>, where he got no small reputation, principally in the siege of
               <span class="placeName">Ostend</span>, and <span class="persName">Nisa</span> a daughter, and if I
               be not partial, one of most excellent beauty, who lived in that honour and good name
               unto which she was bound by the nobleness of her birth and the care of such
               parents.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">Unto these terms was the young man proceeded in his discourse, whereat
               <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> exceedingly troubled covered his <span class="body">face</span> with his <span class="body">hands</span>, whereof the other demanding a
               reason, <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> said to him, that his <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span> which had brought him unto that estate wherein he found him
               was returned again, yet he thought it was with less violence than it had formerly
               done. All this <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> feigned, because the story which the
               Toledan told him, was his own proper story, and this <span class="persName">Nisa</span> whom
               he called his sister, was the pilgrim whose wits were lost out of the apprehension
               of <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’ death; so do acts dissembled many times meet, and
               sometimes do then reappear most when they are most endeavoured to be hidden. I will
               not proceed in my story, said he if thou find not thyself so well, that thou may
               hearken unto me; for there is no time worse employed than that which one loseth in
               speaking to them, which give no<span class="body">ear</span>to the speaker. Thou may
               proceed, said <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, (being desirous to understand the
               estate of his own affairs) for I find my <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span>
               begins to leave me, eased by thy presence and thy words. I must tell thee then, said
               the young man, that there was in <span class="placeName">Madrid</span> a brave Knight, and a
               great friend of my father’s, with whom he had great inwardness of acquaintance, ever
               since the wars of Granada, and I think they were together in that famous Battle of
               Lepanto: from this friendship it followed, that at the end of some years, they
               treated of the marrying of my sister <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, with one of this
               knight’s sons, of whom I now speak, and the young man’s name was
               <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>. But while these things were a-doing, the father of
               <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> died, and the proposition of marriage ceased.
               <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> who by the renown that went of my sister, as also
               by her picture, was taken in her love, and grew wonderful <span class="emotion" title="adj">sad</span> and <span class="emotion" title="noun">melancholy</span>, and falling
               from one imagination to another, in the end he resolved upon this which I shall tell
               thee, that thereby thou may see how innocent those were, who without the light of
               faith, did anciently believe in fortune and destinies. Which was, that making his
               mother believe that he would go into <span class="placeName">Flanders</span>, and journeying
               some days in the habit and equipage of a man at <span class="body">arms</span>, and after
               having sent his servants to Alcalá de Henares, and there disguising himself in other
               clothes, he went to <span class="placeName">Toledo</span>: where not being known to any
               person, he found means to be employed as a servant in my father’s house, which was
               no hard matter to do, because that his excellent feature and countenance accompanied
               with his intelligence were pledges sufficient of his fidelity, and gave my father
               not only a <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> to be served by him, but also
               to respect him. My father received him ignorant of his quality and of his intent (a
               strange imagination of a man, being a knight, and so well known almost of all, in
               the country wherein he was born; that he could so hide himself, at the door (as it
               were) of his own house, that nobody could know, either where he was or what he did)
               yet so it was, that his humility, his diligent service, and other commendable parts
               which he had, gained such credit with my parents, that I do believe he might as
               easily have compassed his designs with his feigned poverty, as with his true
               riches.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">The chiefest thing whereunto he applied himself as his whole study, was to appear
               agreeable to <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, which was easy to be done, for who can guard
               himself from a domestic enemy? The simplicity wherewith this knight did begin his
               treason, and the good words which he used, gained him entrance into those places
               whereinto hardly and with great difficulty, could the ancient servants come. Behold
               with how little care, a noble gentleman kept in his house another Greek horse, like
               unto <span class="emotion" title="adj">miserable</span>
               <span class="placeName">Troy</span>: for such of necessity must this young man’s <span class="body">heart</span> needs be full of thoughts and armed with malice, which (the
               hour of execution approaching) broke forth into such flames, as have fired our
               renown. When <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> thought that <span class="persName">Nisa</span>
               was disposed to hearken to his intention, were it that his sickness were true, or
               feigned; as most likely it was, he made himself sick. My parents, who accounted of
               this servant as of their governor, and loved him equal with their dearest children,
               there being no key about the house, no account in all their expense, nor any secret
               in their affaires, wherein he was not trusted, caused him to be tended with all the
               care which was possible for <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> and respect to
               bring. The physicians said that this infirmity proceeded from a deep melancholy, and
               the best remedy that was to be given, was to rejoice him, and principally by music;
               In which they were not deceived, for if <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> does
               participate of the evil spirit, and that <span class="persName">David</span> drove away the
               evil spirit from <span class="persName">Saul</span> by the sweetness of his harp, by the same
               means <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> might be driven away. Thou sayest
               true, said <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, (who gave great attention unto the
               relation of his own story, to see to what end the discourse of this young man would
               come, who was his mistress’ brother) for without doubt it holdeth many conditions
               of
               the evil spirit, and leaving apart the principal which is to torment with fire,
               behold the sympathy which they have one with the other. The devils do delight
               themselves in things which are naturally <span class="emotion" title="noun">melancholy</span>, inhabiting in horrible places, obscure and solitary, and loving
               darkness and sadness: all which qualities are common with them which <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, and cannot attain to that which they pretend,
               they <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> solitary places, and the dens of
               deserts, there to entertain in silence their <span class="emotion" title="adj">sad</span>
               thoughts, without anything to trouble them, no not the light of heaven. But let me
               entreat thee to proceed in thy story of this knight, for I <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> with <span class="emotion" title="noun">passion</span> to know the
               end.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">My sister <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, said <span class="persName">Celio</span>, then (for so
               was the young man called) could play admirable well of the lute, and sang so sweetly
               that in the like danger, the dolphin would more willingly have brought her to the
               shore, then he did <span class="persName">Arion</span> sometimes to
               <span class="placeName">Corinth</span>. Wherefore by the consent of my parents, and not
               against her will, she went into <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’ little chamber,
               (consider with thyself the <span class="emotion" title="adj">happy</span> glory of a man in
               his case) and sang a poem which he himself had composed, for he had that way a
               dextrous facility, and very natural; neither did it want the excellence of art. But
               whilst <span class="persName">Nisa</span> sang, <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> wept, and
               never turned his <span class="body">eyes</span> from hers; so that one resembled the
               crocodile, and the other a Siren, excepting that one sang to give him health, and
               the other wept to deceive her of her honour. <span class="persName">Nisa</span> seeing his
               extremity of <span class="emotion" title="noun">sadness</span>, said unto him that her
               intent was not that her music should have the same effect in him as it had in
               others, which is, to make them sadder, but contrarily her <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> was to <span class="emotion" title="verb">rejoice</span> him.
               There is (answered he) no other voice nor other harmony, unless it may be the
               harmony of heaven, can <span class="emotion" title="verb">rejoice</span> me but yours:
               nevertheless my evil being past hope of cure, bindeth me to bewail myself, and not
               to think upon anything but upon the beauty which causeth it. What evil is that (said
               <span class="persName">Nisa</span>) past cure, which proceedeth from a cause commended by
               thee? It is an evil (answered <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>) whereof I do hinder
               the cure, and whereof the only comfort is to know that I suffer it for the fairest
               creature in the world. The liberty wherein we live (said <span class="persName">Nisa</span>)
               doth give me leave <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, to speak unto the here of a
               suspicious matter: by the tokens which thou hast delivered unto me of thy evil, thou
               hast given me knowledge of the occasion that makes thee sick, although I am ignorant
               of the cause, who makes the sick: thou lovest without a doubt, and I take it in good
               part that thou wouldst confess unto me, that which thou wouldest not speak unto the
               physicians, assuring thee that thou may better trust my <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> then their art. But I conjure thee, by that goodwill which
               thou knowest I have born thee ever since thou hast served my parents that thou wilt
               tell me whether I know her whom thou lovest, and whether I can be helpful unto thee
               in thy curing, for thy tears doe make me <span class="emotion" title="noun">pity</span>
               thee. You may well serve to help me <span class="emotion" title="adj">pitiful</span>
               <span class="persName">Nisa</span> (said then the cunning lover, who might well have
               instructed <span class="persName">Ovid</span>) seeing I do not hope for it from any other <span class="body">hands</span> than yours, and that you know the cause of my pain, as well
               as you know yourself.<br /></p>
            
            
            
         </div>
         
         
         <p class="prose">Here <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> demanded of <span class="persName">Celio</span> (wondering
            that he should tell so particularly that which passed so secretly between him and
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>) how he knew the same words which they had spoken, he being at
            that time far off, following his study in <span class="placeName">Salamanca</span>? To which
            <span class="persName">Celio</span> answered, that the same <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> had
            left the story in writing with a friend of his, from whom having had the means since
            that
            time to get it, he learned all unto the least particular, and then proceeding on his
            discourse, he continued in this manner:<br /></p>
         
         
         <div class="floating">
            
            
            
            <p class="prose">The colour which came into <span class="persName">Nisa</span>'s <span class="body">face</span>
               when she heard <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’ words, cannot be compared, but unto
               the red rose with milky leaves, although it be a poetical term, and borrowed of the
               same author, yet feigning not to understand what he said, she answered that if it
               were any of her friends she would endeavour (at the least) to bring it about that
               she should know his evil, that thereupon he might lay the foundation of his remedy.
               I am in that state said <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> that I dare not so much as
               sigh or breath out her name, yet I can show you her portrait, which is the original
               cause of my misfortune, and for whose sake I am come from my own country into yours,
               where I remain an humble servant of your house, and do think myself most happy to
               be
               so, although I am a knight, and equal unto her whom you call your friend, and with
               whom I should have been now married, if my father had lived until this day, for only
               his death barred me of this <span class="emotion" title="noun">happiness</span>. And in
               saying these words, <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> gave her her picture, which had
               been drawn by the most excellent painter of our time, called <span class="persName">Philip of
                  Lianho</span>; whose pencil oftentimes durst compare with Nature herself, who
               out of mere <span class="emotion" title="noun">envy</span> unto him for that (as it seemed)
               shortened his days. Yet <span class="persName">Nisa</span> (through whose veins ran a cold
               shivering) affirmed that she did not know the face; I do not wonder said
               <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, that the ancient philosopher hath delivered his
               opinion; that it is a very hard matter to know oneself, putting this sentence: Know
               Thyself, on the facades of the most famous temples. Yet see another more natural,
               the knowledge whereof you cannot deny. Saying this, he reached her a very fair
               looking-glass: <span class="persName">Nisa</span> seeing her <span class="body">face</span> within
               the crystal could no longer suffer his discourse, nor the knight’s presence: but
               rising up in a <span class="emotion" title="noun">fury</span>, said unto him in great <span class="emotion" title="noun">anger</span> as she went away, thy boldness shall cost
               thee thy life. Can it be better employed, answered <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>,
               than for your beauty to be ended?<br /></p>
            
            
            
         </div>
         
         
         <p class="prose">She answered well, said the <span class="persName">Pilgrim</span>, if she had accomplished what
            she said. She accomplished it so ill, replied <span class="persName">Celio</span>, that within a
            few days she <span class="emotion" title="verb">loved</span> him better than she <span class="emotion" title="verb">loved</span> herself, proving the verse of the famous poet Dante
            to be infallibly true: that<span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>excuseth no one who is
            beloved from loving. But how came it (said the pilgrim) that a maid should <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>; who had hearkened with so much disdain in the
            beginning? Because, answered <span class="persName">Celio</span>, that all maids for their first
            answer consult with <span class="emotion" title="noun">shame</span>, and for their second consult
            with weakness: although for my own part, I think that <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>
            <span class="emotion" title="adj">despairing</span> of his remedy helped himself with ch<span class="body">arms</span>. I cannot believe so, answered <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, a
            man hath liberty to love, and not to <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> as it seemeth
            good unto himself, and it seems to be a terrible and cruel thing that a chaste woman
            should be violently constrained to <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, whether she
            would or no: ch<span class="body">arms</span> and witchcraft may peradventure move, persuade
            and tempt without suffering to be in rest, and with these exterior persuasions make
            one
            yield unto the prayers and tears of a lover: yet for all this it cannot be said, that
            she
            is constrained but that of her goodwill, she giveth consent to her <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span>, suffering herself rather to be vanquished by her own proper
            nature, than by the force of any magic art. Wherefore it is an evident folly in those
            which <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, to complain that they are violently
            constrained will he nil he, to follow their <span class="emotion" title="verb">loves</span>,
            because God never suffereth that the power of free will should be taken from Man;
            and if
            anyone say he hath been forced by diabolical persuasions, it may be answered, he was
            not
            forced in his reason, but in his concupiscence: neither is it to be believed that
            a
            knight, a Christian wise young and brave gentleman, would help himself with such wicked
            means to attain his ends. It is not likely, answered <span class="persName">Celio</span>, and it
            may be, that he witnessing his fidelity by other services, obliged her to condescend
            unto
            his will, for <span class="persName">Nisa</span> is not the only woman in this world subject to
            this weakness.<br /></p>
         
         
         <div class="floating">
            
            
            
            <p class="prose">Nevertheless, behold the strange accident which happened unto them both, as a
               beginning of their misfortunes; for it being rumoured at
               <span class="placeName">Madrid</span> that <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> was come from
               <span class="placeName">Flanders</span>, the news thereof came unto my father’s ears, who
               (desirous to make him his son in law, in favour of the ancient acquaintance and <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> he had with his father, and because that it
               had been formerly agreed between them) one day told her, that he was resolved to
               marry her, not naming unto whom; and thereupon writing to
               <span class="placeName">Madrid</span>, to <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’ mother,
               entreating her to send him to <span class="placeName">Toledo</span>, congratulating also
               with her, her son’s happy return and the prosperous success of his affairs, and
               remembered unto her the amity which he had contracted with her husband, his father.
               The <span class="emotion" title="adj">sad</span>
               <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, who already <span class="emotion" title="adverb">desperately</span> loved <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, told him that her father
               would marry her, and the knight who was designed for her husband was shortly to come
               from <span class="placeName">Madrid</span> unto their house, but she knew nothing in
               particular more of him, but that he was a brave soldier who lately came out of
               <span class="placeName">Flanders</span>. <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> (ignorant that he
               was the person who was meant) fell into great extremity at the news, and after many
               tears and other follies, he said he was resolved to be gone, for his <span class="body">heart</span> would never suffer him to see a new servant unto his mistress in this
               house. A strange and never heard of story, that a man should be <span class="emotion" title="adj">jealous</span> of himself, and fly from his own presence.
               <span class="persName">Nisa</span> who now thought it as impossible for her to be without
               <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, as the Earth without water, fire without matter to
               burn, or as the celestial harmony without their first mover, said unto him in
               weeping, that she would have him take her away with him, and that she would follow
               him over the world; yet upon this condition, that he should swear solemnly, never
               to
               lose the respect which was due unto her honour: which oath being taken by
               <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> without any consideration of the danger which might
               happen: he made choice of a dark night, and by a garden which answered upon the
               river, took her from the house, and by the same river went from the town, carrying
               her in his bark, until he came unto those mountains which are called
               <span class="placeName">Sisla</span>: this was it which he writ afterwards from
               <span class="placeName">Valencia</span> to a friend of his of

            <p class="prose">Now follows the beginning of my peregrination, which (having been too long in this
               history) I will briefly relate. At the dolorous letter which was written to me of
               this success (which was discovered as soon as <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> was
               gone from <span class="placeName">Toledo</span>) I came from
               <span class="placeName">Salamanca</span> to my father’s house, which I found all in
               mourning for the loss of my sister. My father in few words obliged me to revenge it,
               which I swore that I would, with many words as free as his were grave: and to
               execute my intent I went to <span class="placeName">Madrid</span>. I sought
               <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> in all the houses of his friends, and visited his
               mother, asking news of him, making show how things had passed. His innocent mother
               said, it was two years since he went into <span class="placeName">Flanders</span>, and that
               from the time of his departure, she never had heard from him, from whence she
               collected he was dead. I thought that she, knowing what he had done, had disguised
               the truth: and while I was in this meditation, I casting my <span class="body">eyes</span> upon a young gentlewoman, who sat sewing by this reverend matron. I
               found her in my mind so fair, that her only look had power to temper my <span class="emotion" title="noun">sorrow</span>, and hardly had I fully viewed her
               perfections, when as I propounded in myself to serve her, and to steal her away,
               thinking by this means to give satisfaction to our honour, and beginning to my
               revenge. To recount unto you at this time all the passages and the care which I used
               to speak with her, and to bring her to my will, would be to trouble you with a long
               discourse; let it satisfy that I drew her from her house with the same thread
               wherewith <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> had pulled <span class="persName">Nisa</span> from
               ours, and in a strange and foolish mind led her into <span class="placeName">France</span>,
               where her beauty ministered subject unto a knight to serve her and for me to kill
               him: from whence it followed that for safety of my life I was driven to leave her.
               Nevertheless, I am resolved whatsoever happen unto me to seek her, because that
               besides, I do <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> her more than myself, I owe so
               much unto her merit and virtue with which she hath faithfully accompanied me,
               through many and variable successes.<br /></p>
            
            
            
         </div>
         
         
         <p class="prose">Night had spread his black veil over the <span class="body">face</span> of the Earth, and the
            houses were as full of candles, as the heaven of stars; men and creatures retired
            themselves, from their common labour, when as the miserable <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>
            gave over hearing the tragedy of his <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, with the
            last act of his honour: and to know that he did then but begin to suffer his evils
            when he
            thought he was at an end of them. He admired the justice of Heaven, which had suffered
            that his sister should so lightly have quitted her mother’s house to run away with
            a man;
            yet finding in himself the example of his own misleading of <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, and
            that the injury which he had done unto <span class="persName">Celio</span> was no less than that
            which he had received, he did not hold it just in himself once to think of revenge,
            but
            rather to persuade him that he should not, nor ought to leave her, which he performed
            with
            the best words, and the liveliest reasons he could devise. Remonstrating unto him
            that
            amongst gentlemen the only condition of nobleness should bind him to seek for her,
            which
            <span class="persName">Celio</span> allowing for most reasonable, gave him his word to employ his
            endeavours to that purpose. And being lodged this night together, they supped and
            slept in
            one house. The next morning <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> gave him a letter to a French
            gentleman with whom he had great acquaintance, that he might favour him in finding
            out
            <span class="persName">Finia</span>, for so was his sister called. But <span class="persName">Celio</span>
            departed not for certain days, during which time there was a perfect friendship knit
            between those two secret enemies; so that <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> knowing the
            offence which <span class="persName">Celio</span> had done unto him, pardoned him in his <span class="body">heart</span>, and <span class="persName">Celio</span> ignorant that this was
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, was disposed to the pardoning of him. The resolution was
            with great oaths to enquire out one the other, and to help each other in all accidents
            as
            brothers; assigning the rendezvous within six months, in the city of
            <span class="placeName">Pamplona</span>.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">So went <span class="persName">Celio</span> upon his enterprise; and some few days after his
            departure, <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’ <span class="emotion" title="noun">sorrow</span>
            increasing out of the opinion that it was impossible for him to recover
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>; it happened that going one night from his lodging in a vain
            <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> he had to see the windows of the prison (where
            his <span class="emotion" title="noun">happiness</span> and <span class="emotion" title="noun">joy</span> was enclosed) he heard a knight cry out for help against some who would at
            advantage have killed him. He suddenly stepped unto him, and drawing out his sword
            out of
            his palmer’s staff with an incredible dexterity, accompanied with a valiant &amp; brave
            courage, made them loose him whom they would have killed, and save their own lives
            by a
            shameful though a safe flight.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">The knight would needs know who he was, who had delivered him from so great danger:
            and
            although <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> excused himself from telling his name, yet the
            knight’s <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> and courtesy prevailed more than the
            humbleness wherewith the pilgrim did endeavour to persuade him that he had done him
            no
            service: to conclude, he led him to his house, where his good and gentle behaviour
            being
            observed, the knight and his parents bore such affection unto him that they did oblige
            him
            to become their guest.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">There remained <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> some days, at the end of which
            <span class="persName">Jacinth</span> (so was this knight called) told him the history of his <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> unto fair <span class="persName">Lucinda</span>, and the
            occasion for which these assassinators wold have murdered him, who for this only cause,
            were come from <span class="placeName">Seville</span> unto <span class="placeName">Valencia</span> where
            the subject of the <span class="emotion" title="noun">passion</span> and the <span class="emotion" title="noun">sorrow</span> wherein he lived did remain. I do believe that lovers have some
            sympathy one with another, and that they join and communicate in such manner as you
            have
            seen in this discourse, seeing that our pilgrim never came into any house where there
            was
            not someone or other tainted with this evil, even though it were in craggy mountains.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">By this overture of <span class="persName">Jacinth</span>’s secret, <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>
            was bound to reveal his: and after he had made him swear that he would grant him his
            request, he said that in recompense of his life which he had saved, as he himself
            confessed, he conjured him to help him to a place, in that prison where the <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span> folks were shut up. <span class="persName">Jacinth</span>, <span class="emotion" title="adj">astonished</span> at so strange a request, would needs know the
            cause. But <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> promising to tell him as soon as he had done him
            that favour, and casting himself at his <span class="body">feet</span> with most earnest and
            unheard of words, affirming the good he should doe him to put him in this place, made
            <span class="persName">Jacinth</span> suspect that some secret danger did enforce him into that
            place. And willing very generously to satisfy the obligation wherein he was tied,
            after
            some inconveniences and reasons urged to divert him, having agreed with him of the
            means
            which he should use. That very night <span class="persName">Jacinth</span> took five or six men of
            the hospital who entering suddenly into <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’ chamber, put him
            in a chair, and carried him away in their <span class="body">arms</span>. <span class="emotion" title="adj">Miserable</span> condition of this man, who after so many strange successes,
            being wise (if those who <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> can be so) to make
            himself to be taken and shut up willingly, as a madman, where all the <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span> folks would willingly be accounted wise.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">All <span class="persName">Jacinth</span>’s house admired at this novelty, and all his family
            complained that this stranger, unto whom <span class="persName">Jacinth</span> owed his life, was
            so unworthily requited by <span class="persName">Jacinth</span> himself: but she who most
            complained of his cruelty and had the truest feeling of it was
            <span class="persName">Tiberia</span> his sister, who was both fair and discreet above all the
            ladies in <span class="placeName">Valencia</span>, who affecting the gentleness and fair spirit of
            our unfortunate pilgrim, did not see but by his <span class="body">eyes</span>, and did not
            breathe but from him. <span class="persName">Jacinth</span> told them that
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> was <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span>, and that it
            was necessary he should be cured before the disease increased too far. The father
            of this
            knight, who was very learned, blamed exceedingly this precipitate course, saying that
            in
            all infirmities there was nothing more dangerous than physic out of season, and swore
            that
            he should be had out of the hospital to be cured in his house.
            <span class="persName">Tiberia</span> confirmed this piety, saying that reward due unto him, they
            being not so poor, but that they had means sufficient to have him cured in their house,
            with greater care of his health, and less scandal to his honour
            <span class="persName">Jacinth</span> replied that he was a stranger, and that nobody knew him.
            But all the household were so much against him, blaming him for ingratitude, especially
            his father and his sister, that he was constrained to tell them what he knew. Whereat
            in
            imagining the cause, all of them were astonished, and wondered. They thought that
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> was a spy, who went disguised under the habit of a
            pilgrim, and that <span class="emotion" title="verb">fearing</span> to be known by someone, he
            used this subtility to save his life: for although he spoke Spanish, nevertheless,
            by his
            fair <span class="body">face</span> and exceeding beauty, he seemed a stranger, and by his
            actions a gentleman. With this confession, <span class="persName">Jacinth</span> remained in their
            good opinion, though the house was much troubled, and <span class="persName">Tiberia</span> was
            full of <span class="emotion" title="adj">pitiful</span>
            <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span> and care for <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’
            life: who being in prison among the <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span> folks (in the
            judgement of many, the very centre of greatest misery) imagined himself to be in most
            glorious happiness.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">To this new madman the more ancient gave place, and <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, with
            divers feignings and counterfeitings of his <span class="body">face</span>, endeavoured to
            express his madness; which fashion of his, seeming them as tokens of rashness, they
            put
            him into the prison with irons on his <span class="body">hands</span>, where to confirm them
            the more in their opinion of his madness, he said so many words so far from the matter,
            that his affliction was believed. There he stayed some few days before he could see
            his
            beloved <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, suffering most insupportable discommodities, difficult
            to be spoken of, and almost impossible to be believed; in the meantime
            <span class="persName">Celio</span> went by <span class="placeName">Saragossa</span> into
            <span class="placeName">France</span>, to find his beautiful and beloved
            <span class="persName">Finia</span> whom he had lost, where being come, he heard the news of the
            peace which was proclaimed between the two nations, which made him rest that night
            (with
            more <span class="emotion" title="noun">contentment</span> out of the facility which it brought
            to his design) staying for the light of the morning to clear his passage over the
            mountains into <span class="placeName">France</span>.<br /></p>

         <p class="prose">Whilst the <span class="emotion" title="adj">sad</span> and afflicted <span class="persName">Celio</span>
            entered into <span class="placeName">France</span> by the mountains of <span class="placeName">Jaca</span>
            to see if he could find his dear <span class="persName">Finia</span>, our pilgrim
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> having gotten out of the prison, as a madman whose fury
            was over, was admitted to the table where others did eat, where also sat his fair
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>; near unto whom he did always endeavour to sit, and there and
            in all other convenient places he told her his fortunes. She blamed him for putting
            himself into this place, although she did acknowledge how she was tied unto him, for
            this
            his great folly.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose"><span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> as a true lover, who only aimed at the end of his love,
            which was to marry her, and who had sworn by a thousand oaths to resist the violence
            of
            his <span class="emotion" title="verb">desires</span> until a lawful marriage would suffer him to
            accomplish them, said unto her in comforting her, that if she had suffered this <span class="emotion" title="noun">misery</span> for him, and that they ought to be all one, there
            was no reason but he should have his part of this misery, to the end that equal in
            all
            things, their marriage might be without advantage of one side or another, and that
            his <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> unto her did prevail so far as not to let pass one
            day without seeing her, notwithstanding any danger, and although his honour were thereby
            in hazard. The servants of the house did not hinder their speaking together, because
            that
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span> being apparelled like a man, and having a care that her <span class="body">hair</span> should not reveal her sex, everybody did believe that she was as
            she seemed to be. For although that her beauty were extreme, yet the world hath not
            any so
            great, but it appeareth little, being much neglected; especially seeing that if art
            do not
            polish the beautifullest and finest diamonds, and that they be not set in gold with
            enamelling and other necessary ornaments, they show not the lustre, grace nor beauty
            which
            they have being artificially cut and set in a foil by cunning workmen.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">The <span class="emotion" title="noun">misery</span> of this kind of life seemed unto our two
            lovers as nothing in regard of the former travails which they had suffered, as I have
            heard it often said by many: and I myself know by experience that if two lovers may
            see
            and speak together, they have no feeling of the miseries which do serve them as means
            to
            attain thereunto. Oh what will not those which <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>
            resolve of! What is it, which doth not seem possible unto them? What travails can
            <span class="emotion" title="adj">weary</span> them? And what dangers can make them fear? O <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> strong as death: seeing that a lover living in that
            which he <span class="emotion" title="verb">loves</span>, and being dead in himself, hath no more
            feeling of torment then a<span class="body">body</span>deprived of a soul. With what tears were
            these two separated at night, by the cruel officers of this prison? (If it be cruelty
            to
            deal rigorously with <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span> folks) with what care and
            languishment did they attend the day that they might see one the other? What discreet
            follies did they utter in public, full of equivocations to deceive those who heard
            them,
            and to divert the evils which they suffered? And with what amorous discourses did
            they in
            particular warm their <span class="emotion" title="verb">desires</span> to marry? How much doth
            he commend <span class="persName">Nisa</span>'s virtue, and the chaste but loving defence which she
            made of her honour, for <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> being a man had yielded often unto
            his <span class="emotion" title="noun">passion</span>, if she had not moderated his violence?
            With what grace they gave madly, favours one unto another, of the wildest things they
            could find upon the ground, which <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> stuck in his hat, instead
            of jewels or feathers which he was wont to wear. But fortune <span class="emotion" title="verb">envying</span> their <span class="emotion" title="noun">contentedness</span>, even in this <span class="emotion" title="noun">misery</span>, would not let them live in this place at rest,
            but arming himself anew against them, even at that time when as they thought (by
            <span class="persName">Jacinth</span>’s help) to get out of that prison, there came unto this
            city an Italian earl, of the house of Aguilora, called <span class="persName">Emilio</span>, who
            desiring to have a Fool with him, promised a great alms unto their house if they would
            give him a madman, who having lost his <span class="emotion" title="noun">fury</span> might
            entertain him with sport. Those of the hospital failed not to promise him one, and
            withal
            to bring him to his lodging some of their most peaceable madmen, amongst whom were
            the
            pilgrim <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> and the fair <span class="persName">Nisa</span>. The
            <span class="persName">Earl</span>
            <span class="emotion" title="adj">joyful</span> to see them, inquired of their keepers their
            conditions, one of whom answered thus:<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">This man strong and able who you see there, was sometimes a brave soldier, who having
            served upon many occasions like a <span class="persName">Hector</span>, desired the reward of his
            valour which he had merited above all other. But he finding himself denied, and that
            it
            was given unto the cowardliest fellow in the army, fell from this imagination into
            so
            profound a <span class="emotion" title="noun">melancholy</span>, that he lost his wits. He hath
            lost his <span class="emotion" title="noun">fury</span>in the prison although oftentimes it
            returns. His discourse is always of marshalling an army, of besieging a fort, of lodging
            a
            camp, or causing it to march. All is sluices, dykes, trenches, platforms, ravelins,
            casemates, flankers, palisadoes, counterscarps, squadrons, cannons, muskets, pistols,
            corselets, pikes. This weak and pale man is of another humour, who having given himself
            too much to the study of philosophy, lost his understanding. Of this man the
            <span class="persName">Earl</span> demanded, which was the Primum Mobile, either Coelum Imperium,
            or Coelum Crystallinum? unto whom the madman answered thus:<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">After moving the spheres by a local motion, the divines do teach us that there is
            another heaven perpetually in rest from all motion, created from the beginning, and
            full of an innumerable thousands of intelligences and of <span class="emotion" title="adj">happy</span> spirits, which were created together in it and with it. In
            such sort as the mingled bodies are accustomed to engender some things in inferior
            places, as fishes in the water, birds in the air and the vegetative creatures,
            plants and minerals in the earth. This heaven for its greatness and for its
            inestimable light, is called Imperial, as who should say Fiery (not for the natural
            property of fire, but for the glorious clearness wherewith it shineth) is the throne
            destined before the constitution of the world, and as a royal palace ordained from
            the beginning, for all those who are to reign before the <span class="body">face</span>
            of God, the light whereof is so lustrous and clear, that the corporal <span class="body">eyes</span> cannot behold or look upon it, no more than the birds of the
            night can the sun.<br /></p>
         
         
         
         <p class="prose">All the assistants remaining <span class="emotion" title="adj">astonished</span> at this
            discourse, another one of the madmen began to cry, calling his dogs, and luring his
            hawks
            like the great falconer and huntsman as he had been; of whom, as the
            <span class="persName">Earl</span> began to laugh, <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> said thus unto
            him; you ought not mock at this exercise, but at those who exercise it unorderly and
            untimely, without respecting either season or place: for according to
            <span class="persName">Xenophon</span> and <span class="persName">Athenaeus</span>, hunting was famous
            amongst the Persians. <span class="persName">Homer</span> said it was practised amongst the Greeks
            that thereby their young men might become hardier; for as Horace writes, the Hunter
            often
            lies abroad in the cold night without remembering his wife. <span class="persName">Philon</span>
            the Hebrew tells notable things of hunting, in his Pre<span class="body">face</span> unto his
            Warfare. <span class="persName">Cicero</span> says no less, in his book of The Nature of the Gods.
            And <span class="persName">Peter Gregory</span> says that the original thereof, was in the
            beginning of the world to the end that men should be able to free themselves from
            the
            persecutions of beasts. If hunting, replied the <span class="persName">Earl</span>, (who was a man
            of great knowledge) had not passed from the honest exercise (the imitation of war)
            unto
            that of <span class="emotion" title="noun">pleasure</span>, who would doubt of the excellence
            thereof? But in regard of the hurt it doth in the fields, and the expense which it
            brings
            unto him who follows it? <span class="persName">Louis the Twelfth</span> King of
            <span class="placeName">France</span> justly forbade it: for what else is the meaning of the
            fable of <span class="persName">Actaeon</span>, devoured by his dogs, but that overmuch hunting
            wastes both goods and life? And passing by many other things, which might be gathered
            from
            this verse of Virgil, where he says, <span class="persName">Aeneas</span> and sad
            <span class="persName">Dido</span> went a-hunting together in a wood: joined also the dangers of
            life which cannot be told, neither is it to be wondered at, that this man became <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span>, seeing that as <span class="persName">Dion </span>assureth the
            same exercise made the <span class="persName">Emperor Adrian</span> a fool. Then answered the <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span> hunter, that with more reason should he be laid in
            this place for a madman, because he would persuade madmen, and reason with them who
            had no
            reason.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">The discourse of this madman, said the <span class="persName">Earl</span> savouring nothing of
            madness, obliges me to answer: for a man must fight with those who give occasion,
            play
            with such as have money, and answer unto everyone in the same manner he speaks. But
            if all
            the madmen in <span class="placeName">Spain</span> were as you, and that my children should remain
            there, I should rather <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> to have them ignorant
            than learned; know said the fool that if it were possible a man should <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> to be born in <span class="placeName">France</span>, to live in
            <span class="placeName">Italy</span> and to die in <span class="placeName">Spain</span>, to be born for
            the nobleness of the French, who always have had their king of their own nation, and
            never
            mingled with any other; to live, for the liberty and felicity of
            <span class="placeName">Italy</span>: and to die for the Catholic faith which is so certain in
            all <span class="placeName">Spain</span>. And as concerning your children, whatsoever happens of
            it, suffer them not to live in ignorance; for there is less danger in being <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span>, than in being ignorant. Whilst this man spoke,
            another singing near to him let the <span class="persName">Earl</span> know that music had brought
            him to that estate, for it is said; that it is a kinswoman to poetry: the ancients
            said
            the madmen have comprised music amongst the liberal sciences.
            <span class="persName">Aristotle</span> in his Politics, <span class="persName">Budeus</span> in his
            Commentary upon the Greek <span class="body">tongue</span> and <span class="persName">Caelius the
               Rhodian</span> do say that music is a mixture compounded of sounds sweet, flat and sharp.
            <span class="persName">Plutarch</span> in the life of <span class="persName">Homer</span> puts one voice
            flat and the other sharp, the flat voice proceeds from within and the sharp from the
            area
            of the <span class="body">mouth</span>, and from their divers tempering make the harmony; the
            object of the hearing is the sound, and the reflection of the air, as Galen teaches;
            and
            the sound is made from the act of some one thing into another, by the means of the
            stroke
            which causes it: two bodies are required to make a sound, because that one cannot
            do it.
            The echo is an air struck into hollow places, which resisting the stroke of the voice,
            return the same words which are spoken. So say <span class="persName">Themiserus</span>,
            <span class="persName">Pliny</span>, <span class="persName">Ovid</span> and <span class="persName">Macrobius</span>
            in his Saturnales. The voice and the word are not one thing, the word holds the ground
            from the <span class="body">tongue</span> helped by the <span class="body">nostrils</span>, the <span class="body">lips</span> and the <span class="body">teeth</span>: and the instruments of the
            voice are the <span class="body">throat</span>, the muscles which move, and the nerves which
            come down from the brain. Who was the first inventor of music? asked the
            <span class="persName">Earl</span>. The madman answered, <span class="persName">Josephus</span> said that
            it was <span class="persName">Tubal, Adam’s nephew</span>, although that
            others give the invention to <span class="persName">Mercury</span>, as <span class="persName">Gregory
               Gerand</span>: and <span class="persName">Philostratus</span> said that
            <span class="persName">Mercury</span> learned it from <span class="persName">Orpheus</span> and
            <span class="persName">Amphion</span>. But <span class="persName">Eusebius</span> attributes it to
            <span class="persName">Dionysus</span>. Then asked the <span class="persName">Earl</span>, into how many parts music was divided?
            The madman answered, according to <span class="persName">Boetius</span>, into the theoretical and
            the practical, be it either natural, artificial, celestial or human; the natural and
            celestial is that which is considered in the harmony of all the parts of the world:
            the
            human is that which treats of the proportions of the<span class="body">body</span>and of the
            soul, and their parts: for <span class="persName">Plato</span>, <span class="persName">Pythagoras</span> and
            <span class="persName">Architas</span> have thought that the motions and conversions of the stars
            cannot be without music. And <span class="persName">Vitruvius</span> is of the opinion that
            buildings are not framed without music. Leaving celestial and human, there follows
            artificial, divided into musical organs and Instruments.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">Thereupon the other madmen began to put in practice that whereof he only showed the
            theory, and began to make such a noise with confused and discording voices, that it
            was
            impossible to understand them. But being appeased, he who kept the madmen made great
            account unto the <span class="persName">Earl</span>e of a <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span>
            astrologer, who by the contemplation of such high things was fallen into this abasement.
            Hardly had the <span class="persName">Earl</span> looked upon him, when he began to tell him that
            the composition and figure of the world in its form was called a sphere which was
            solid,
            and that passing through the middle, the poles were placed in the extremes or vertical
            points immovable: one made the North on this side of the Bear, and from the stars
            of that
            part of heaven called Aquila, Boreal or Arctic; The other which was opposite by diameter
            was called Antarctic and meridional; there was he interrupted by others, who would
            not let
            him proceed, and after it was not possible to appease them, although there were a
            great
            many more painters, poets and mathematicians, but above all there was an alchemist,
            a
            famous disciple of <span class="persName">Raymundus Lullius</span>.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">At this time <span class="persName">Emilio</span> had fixed his <span class="body">eyes</span> upon
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, and beholding the sadness with which she was silent, he
            demanded of the Master the humour of this <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span> creature?
            Who answered him, that <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> had brought him to his
            folly. Her delicate <span class="body">face</span>, and the occasion of her evil, gave him at
            the same time <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> and compassion with such
            affection, that agreeing with the Master at the price of a hundred crowns, he made
            choice
            of her from amongst all the other to lead her into <span class="placeName">Italy</span>. But
            hardly had <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> seen the effects of this election, when as his
            <span class="emotion" title="noun">fury</span> increasing truly, which was before but feigned,
            he struck, he bit and took on, as if he had been <span class="emotion" title="adj">enraged</span>
            against those who took his dear <span class="persName">Nisa</span> away. But they being a great
            many against him alone, the <span class="persName">Earl</span> took her from the house, and shortly
            after from <span class="placeName">Valencia</span>. And <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> tied up as
            a madman, was had back again with many grievous blows, bewailing <span class="emotion" title="adverb">bitterly</span> the loss of his dear <span class="persName">Nisa</span>. And by how
            much he endeavoured to make the officers believe that he was not <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span>, by so much the more he persuaded them that he was not well in his
            wits: because being oppressed with <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span> he told them
            plainly that he had caused himself to be brought thither only to see this young <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span> creature, whom they had accounted to be a man, but
            indeed was a woman and his wife, whom he had concealed under this habit for <span class="emotion" title="noun">fear</span> of her father, from whom he had stolen her away.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">But they were so confirmed in their opinion of his madness, that by those reasons
            whereby
            he did think they were tied to give him his liberty, he made them more obstinate to
            refuse
            him, until they might have more evident tokens of the tranquillity of his mind. Whilst
            he
            did complain to see that it served him to no purpose to tell the truth, which of all
            things in the world doth most <span class="emotion" title="verb">enrage</span> a man, and that in
            regard of <span class="persName">Jacinth</span>’s absence, he could not tell unto whom to have
            recourse. The unfortunate <span class="persName">Nisa</span> was meanwhile come to
            <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>, with so much <span class="emotion" title="noun">sorrow</span>
            and tears that <span class="persName">Emilio</span> already repented that he had bought her:
            inasmuch as there is nothing more unprofitable than a <span class="emotion" title="adj">sad</span> fool. The <span class="persName">Earl</span> embarked, not knowing that she whom he led
            with him had the fortune of <span class="persName">Scianus</span>’ horse, which cost his masters
            their lives: He endeavoured to <span class="emotion" title="verb">rejoice</span>
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, causing her to sit at his table, to make her eat meat, because
            it was told him that she would famish herself to death, where earnestly beholding
            her <span class="body">face</span>, and considering her actions, he did suspect, that she was neither
            mad, nor a man: He let this day pass over, and the next day he was assured of both;
            Inasmuch as so great a <span class="emotion" title="noun">sadness</span> could not be feigned;
            and that <span class="persName">Nisa</span>'s reserved speech and the modesty of her looks declared
            openly that which upon other occasions she had hidden with so much care;
            <span class="persName">Emilio</span> being then persuaded that this mad creature was a woman, or
            at the least having evident tokens thereof, inquired with great care of her <span class="emotion" title="noun">sadness</span>, using her as a gentlewoman, and with respect due
            unto her sex. <span class="persName">Nisa</span> who had now neither care to disguise herself nor
            to live, confessed she was a woman, and would not be comforted by
            <span class="persName">Emilio</span>'s words: but <span class="persName">Emilio</span>, who the more he
            conversed with her the more was engaged in her <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, in
            the end suffered himself to be vanquished in her beauty: for <span class="persName">Nisa</span> now
            ceasing to appear as a man captivated all those who beheld her with her marvellous
            grace.
            <span class="emotion" title="noun">Love</span> then began to make himself master over
            <span class="persName">Emilio</span> through <span class="emotion" title="noun">pity</span>, which is
            the cloak under which it enters into our minds; as the pill under gold, that the <span class="emotion" title="noun">bitterness</span> may not offend: and his <span class="emotion" title="noun">passion</span> increased so far as to <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span>
            to know her evil and to procure her remedy. But neither for any effect of love, nor
            hope
            of remedy that he could give her would <span class="persName">Nisa</span> witness any feeling of
            <span class="emotion" title="noun">pleasure</span>, or obligation to him: all which served to
            sharpen <span class="persName">Emilio</span>’s <span class="emotion" title="verb">desires</span>, which he
            did make appear with greater demonstrations: whereat <span class="persName">Nisa</span> being <span class="emotion" title="verb">grieved</span>, endeavoured to divert him from her <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, conjuring him with tears that he would not lead her
            in this indecent habit. The <span class="persName">Earl</span> being courteous offered her other
            clothes, but she assured him that she had made a vow never to wear any but pilgrim’s
            habit, until she had seen the Patron of <span class="placeName">Spain</span> in Galicia.
            <span class="persName">Emilio</span> nevertheless did make her one of serge, and the pilgrim
            being new clothed appeared more beautiful, there being no new apparel which doth not
            embellish, nor so poor a habit new which doth not enrich a well-proportioned <span class="body">body</span>.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">But by this time, a great fog with a tempestuous wind arising in the gulf, the mariners
            knew by the signs which are wont to forerun such storms that they were likely to undergo
            a
            great hazard of drowning. Their presage was not vain, for the wind rose with such
            extremity and violence and the sea wrought with such huge billows that the Masters
            could
            no more command, nor the rowers obey. The Captain was astonished, the pilot pale,
            some
            cried, others silent and without stirring remained as men in a trance with <span class="emotion" title="noun">fear</span>. And in this confusion which continued six hours,
            the <span class="emotion" title="adj">miserable</span> galley split against the rocks;
            <span class="persName">Emilio</span> who now no more remembered his <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, and who knew not that the unfortunateness of <span class="persName">Nisa</span>
            brought forth this effect (clean contrary unto <span class="persName">Caesar</span>’s fortune,
            which appeased storms) endeavoured to save his life with much travail: and the heaven
            reserving <span class="persName">Nisa</span>'s life to run greater fortunes, cast her as formerly
            she had been upon the shore of <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">Those which remained alive were cast away in the same place: <span class="persName">Nisa</span>
            having stayed some time to recover herself after this fortune went in pilgrimage to
            <span class="placeName">Marseille</span>: where one day visiting the famous Church of the
            Penitent, whom the angels buried in the mountain where God gave his laws to
            <span class="persName">Moses</span>, she saw a woman, a pilgrim as herself though in other habit,
            who with great <span class="emotion" title="noun">devotion</span> was upon her <span class="body">knees</span> at the stairs of the great altar. She appeared to <span class="persName">Nisa</span>
            to be a Spaniard, wherefore desiring better to inform herself, obliged thereunto,
            by her
            <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> unto the country, she stayed at the gate whereat
            (when having done her devotions) she came forth, and <span class="persName">Nisa</span> saluting
            her, they both found that they were Castilians: their <span class="emotion" title="noun">joy</span> was so great that it had been confirmed by embraces, if the man’s apparel
            which <span class="persName">Nisa</span> wore, had not hindered it: and little by little they went
            apart, that they might speak more freely, and with less <span class="emotion" title="noun">fear</span> of the French, who already begun to behold their beauties: and being placed
            under a rock which was adjoining the sea, <span class="persName">Nisa</span> said thus unto her, of
            what province are you, fair Spaniard? Of the Kingdom of <span class="placeName">Toledo</span>
            (answered the pilgrim) and of the greatest city, having merited to lodge the kings
            for
            many years: you are then of <span class="placeName">Madrid</span> replied
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, and so we are here met by chance two pilgrims of one country,
            for I am also of <span class="placeName">Toledo</span>. Then, said the pilgrim, fetching a great
            sigh: there was born the cause of my peregrination, and of my misfortune. It is easy
            to be
            seen in thy youth and in thy beauty, that <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> hath
            brought you into these parts; and if it be of a gentleman of whom thou dost complain,
            I
            believe I know him. It may be so, said the pilgrim of <span class="placeName">Madrid</span>, and
            believe me so soon as I saw you I was abashed, because you have the very countenance
            of my
            enemy; you wish me evil by all circumstance, then said <span class="persName">Nisa</span>: rather
            all good replied the pilgrim; for all that resembles his<span class="body">body</span>is
            agreeable to me, only I complain of the cruelty of his mind. Will you not tell me
            his name
            or his parents? said <span class="persName">Nisa</span>. I hazard a small matter in telling thee
            that, answered she; for contrariwise I gain thus much, that it seems to me I am quiet
            and
            at peace, having seen thee, which since I lost him never came to me before now. His
            name
            is <span class="persName">Celio</span>, and the name of a sister which he hath is
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, which are the best tokens I can give thee, to make him known
            to thee; because besides that she is famous for her beauty, she is also more famous
            for
            her disgrace. <span class="persName">Nisa</span> remained <span class="emotion" title="adj">astonished</span> to hear her own name and her brother <span class="persName">Celio</span>’s (for
            this pilgrim was <span class="persName">Finia</span>, <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’ sister, who
            had been left in <span class="placeName">France</span> as you have already heard) wherefore she
            desired earnestly to know the particular of this story, which <span class="persName">Finia</span>
            related in the same manner as <span class="persName">Celio</span> had done to
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>. In the city of <span class="placeName">Valencia</span>, accusing
            his <span class="emotion" title="noun">jealousy</span>, which had made him cruelly kill a French
            gentleman from whose death ensued his absence, and all the miseries and travails which
            she
            had since endured; <span class="persName">Nisa</span> dissembling that part which she had in the
            story, blamed the cruelty of her brother <span class="persName">Celio</span>, and with the <span class="emotion" title="noun">contentment</span>, which she received in seeing
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’ portrait, in <span class="persName">Finia</span> her beauty, she
            tempered her grief for his absence, and her <span class="emotion" title="noun">sorrow</span>
            which she had, that both their parents should lose their children for one cause: then
            did
            she tell her that she knew <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, and that it was not long since
            she saw him, assuring her (as one verily believing) that he was in
            <span class="placeName">Spain</span>: <span class="persName">Finia</span> demanded of
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span> how she knew him, and where it was that she had seen him? And
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span> because she would not reveal herself, told her that she had
            known him at <span class="placeName">Constantinople</span>, where they had been both slaves
            together: <span class="persName">Finia</span> bursting into tears, embraced
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span> and implored her to tell her name and the story of her brother
            if she knew it: <span class="persName">Nisa</span> answered that <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>
            himself had heretofore in his captivity told it to her, and that she would willingly
            recount it to her: but first she deceived <span class="persName">Finia</span> in telling her that
            her name was <span class="persName">Felix</span>, and that going from <span class="placeName">Toledo</span>
            with a captain who embarked in <span class="placeName">Cartagena</span>, they had been made
            captives in passing to <span class="placeName">Oran</span> and afterwards had to
            <span class="placeName">Algiers</span>, where a Turk of <span class="placeName">Constantinople</span>
            had bought her. And so following the story of <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> which was
            also hers, from the beginning as you have heard related by <span class="persName">Celio</span>
            until their departure from <span class="placeName">Toledo</span>, she began to say as follows:<br /></p>
         
         
         <div class="floating">
            
            
            <p class="narrative">The Story of <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> and
               <span class="persName">Nisa</span>.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p class="prose">After that <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> went away from
               <span class="placeName">Toledo</span> with <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, thinking that her
               father would marry her with another, and being <span class="emotion" title="adj">jealous</span> of himself, he told me that suffering some of those discommodities,
               which do offer themselves unto such men as travail without their lawful wives, they
               came to <span class="placeName">Seville</span>, a beautiful city, if the sun shine upon any,
               for riches, greatness, magnificence, policy, haven and staple of the
               <span class="placeName">Indies</span>: where it may be said that twice every year, there
               enters the substance of all <span class="placeName">Spain</span>. There would
               <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> enjoy the beauties of <span class="persName">Nisa</span>;
               but on a sudden he lost the respect which he was accustomed to bear to her chastity
               against the oath which he had solemnly sworn, and hid himself for some days out of
               her sight, during which time he was ready to grow <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span>; yet finding her again, and craving pardon with new oaths to keep the
               first inviolably, they were friends again.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">But <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> being one day at the market place, he was
               recognised by a merchant of <span class="placeName">Toledo</span>, a great friend to
               <span class="persName">Nisa</span> her father, who going about to lay <span class="body">hands</span> on him and apprehend him, <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> was enforced
               to lay <span class="body">hand</span> upon his sword, to defend himself from the Justice.
               It happened well for <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, whose courage and address in
               <span class="body">arms</span> is incredible, and accompanied with an admirable force;
               He was nevertheless constrained to depart speedily from
               <span class="placeName">Seville</span>. And he thinking it discommodious for him to lead
               <span class="persName">Nisa</span> with him in her woman’s apparel, he clothed her in a
               suit of his, and cutting off her <span class="body">hair</span> (of which he after made
               great relics), he girt a sword to her side, and so they went to
               <span class="placeName">Lisbon</span> together; but they were hardly accommodated in their
               lodging, when as a captain, and a great friend to <span class="persName">Lisard</span>,
               <span class="persName">Nisa</span>’s elder brother, who was now in
               <span class="placeName">Flanders</span>, had advertisement of their coming. Although
               <span class="persName">Nisa</span> were sufficiently disguised, yet her countenance (to
               those who had formerly seen her) being sufficiently known, would easily reveal that
               which they did so carefully endeavour to hide.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">But their good fortune (which delivered them from these dangers, it may be to
               reserve them for greater) would at that time, wherein the captain and his friends
               came to search for <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, that <span class="persName">Nisa</span>
               was alone in the lodging, of whom having enquired her name and her masters, she said
               she was a boy who served <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> de
               <span class="persName">Luxan</span>, a knight of <span class="placeName">Madrid</span>, not
               thinking that it did import to tell his name in a strange country. The captain never
               informed himself farther for what he sought; but his ensign inquired news of
               <span class="persName">Nisa</span>; whereat she being troubled, and repenting that she had
               said anything of <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, answered that she was gone by sea
               with <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> to refresh themselves as far as
               <span class="placeName">Belen</span>, a famous monastery and the ancient sepulchre of the
               Kings of <span class="placeName">Portugal</span>. This sudden lie of
               <span class="persName">Nisa</span> saved <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’ life, or at the
               least the honour of both those lovers: for the soldiers went presently to the haven
               attending there for their return; and the captain accounting them already taken, and
               liking <span class="persName">Nisa</span> her fashion, behaviour and countenance exceeding
               well, entreated her to become his page, assuring her that he would use her better
               than any that ever had worn his casque: <span class="persName">Nisa</span> seemed to yield
               with great willingness, if he pleased to accept of his service, and dissembling the
               care and <span class="emotion" title="noun">fear</span> which she had of
               <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’ life, said to the captain that having spoken with
               her master and given him an account of such jewels and other things as were in his
               custody, he would not fail to come to him; with this answer the captain and the
               soldiers were hardly gone out of the doors, when <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> came
               out of the town to his lodging, little thinking his enemies were so near to him:
               what help do strange countries bring to those unto whom misfortunes are ever
               domestic? <span class="persName">Nisa</span> told him the danger which threatened him, and
               <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> having recourse to the remedy, took a speedy
               resolution to leave <span class="placeName">Spain</span>. <span class="persName">Nisa</span> promised
               to follow him through seas and lands, (howsoever unknown) and a Portuguese knight
               who had a company in <span class="placeName">Ceuta</span> offered to conduct him.
               <span class="placeName">Ceuta</span> is a frontier tower of the Moors in
               <span class="placeName">Africa</span>, not far from <span class="placeName">Tetouan</span>, and as
               it were placed to confront <span class="placeName">Gibraltar</span>, as the uttermost bound of
               <span class="placeName">Europe</span>: by which place it is said the Moors entered, who
               under the leading of Julian conquered <span class="placeName">Spain</span>. There remained
               our two lovers for some time in great peace; although <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>
               discontent to see his desires denied by <span class="persName">Nisa</span> her chaste
               resolution, had no great quietness in his own mind. He would have married her, but
               it was not possible to persuade <span class="persName">Nisa</span> unto it; she thinking it
               would be a great disparagement unto her honour for her to be married in this manner:
               and then when he seemed with reason to persuade her, she contradicted him with
               tears, remonstrating that she was his, and that true <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> had a respect unto an honest end, whereas he who propounded unto
               himself only delight, differed little from a beast. <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>
               cursed these reasons of <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, and sometimes out of grief, would
               go a whole day and not speak to her, until in the end overcome with her sweet
               patience, he was constrained to send a thousand sighs as ambassadors for a peace to
               her, who had the empire over him.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">Now the noble courage of this young knight, seeing himself amongst so many brave
               soldiers, who went every day to the wars against the Moors, did believe that it was
               a dishonour to his birth to carry a sword idle by his side, whilst others bathed
               theirs in their enemies’ blood; wherefore one morning from the watchtowers, the
               bells and trumpets giving the alarm, incited by his own generosity and with the
               disdains wherewith <span class="persName">Nisa</span> in his opinion had disgraced him three
               or four days before, he went forth armed at all points, having a red scarf upon his
               left<span class="body">arm</span> a white feather upon his helm, and a mountain of snow
               upon his shield; from the top of which, as from <span class="placeName">Mount Etna</span> in
               <span class="placeName">Sicily</span> came a <span class="body">mouth</span> of fire. So went
               <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> out upon his bay horse, which had a black mane and
               a black tail, and a white star on the <span class="body">forehead</span>, filling the
               Portuguese with admiration to see with what address he managed him; and how
               gracefully he bore his lance; but <span class="persName">Nisa</span> her evil fortune or his
               own <span class="emotion" title="adj">desperate</span> resolution who prayed at his
               departure that she might not see him return alive, suffered the battle to be ordered
               in such manner that day that the Christians had the worst; and
               <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> searching death, broke into a squadron of Moors
               where being wounded and overthrown, he was taken and led prisoner unto
               <span class="placeName">Fez</span>.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">The news of this accident came speedily to <span class="persName">Nisa</span>’s ears, for
               the report of evil successes come sooner to the<span class="body">ears</span>of lovers
               than that of <span class="emotion" title="adj">happy</span> events: what her <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span> was it is not necessary to express, otherwise
               than in representing <span class="persName">Nisa</span> far from her parents, out of her own
               country, and from any friends, and which was most, from the dear presence of him for
               whose sake she had quitted all these, and for whose loss she was almost out of her
               wits. But as the greatest encounters of fortune do sometime bring forth the greatest
               strength and courage of the mind; so <span class="persName">Nisa</span>’s <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span> raised in her mind such valiant virtue, that she boldly
               thrust herself into the acquaintance and friendship of a Moor, who with a safe
               conduct trafficked in <span class="placeName">Ceuta</span>: him she so far gained with her
               affability and presence, that he lead her with him to <span class="placeName">Fez</span>
               under the habit of an Arab, he teaching her in a few days the greatest part of the
               language (of which she was not altogether ignorant before) <span class="persName">Nisa</span>
               thus lived in <span class="placeName">Fez</span> in the habit of a Moor, and under the name
               of nephew to this barbarian, who charmed with her understanding, gentleness of
               spirit and graceful behaviour, endeavoured to persuade her to leave our religion,
               promising to give him his daughter with the best part of his estate, which was
               exceeding much. <span class="persName">Nisa</span> did not refuse him, nevertheless she
               entreated him that he would first suffer her to be instructed in the law, that she
               might receive it with more assurance, and more quietness of mind. With these words
               and with her beauty, <span class="persName">Nisa</span> grew absolute master of this Moor, of
               his women (wherein they abound) of <span class="persName">Leila Acha</span> his daughter, of
               his goods, his slaves and his horses: upon which as she rode up and down the town
               for her <span class="emotion" title="noun">pleasure</span>, she was almost adored by these
               barbarians. She called herself <span class="persName">Hassan Rubin</span> amongst them, a
               name which <span class="persName">Ali Japha</span> had given her in memory of his son, in
               whose place he accounted of her, saying that she was his portraiture. Amongst
               <span class="persName">Ali Japha</span>’s slaves there was one Spaniard, with whom
               <span class="persName">Nisa</span> having many times speech, she entreated him that he
               would inquire secretly with whom a slave of the Kingdom of
               <span class="placeName">Toledo</span> lived; and whose name was
               <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>? This man found out the same day, and following her
               when she was alone, he told her that <span class="persName">Sali Murat</span> had taken him
               in a battle which was fought in <span class="placeName">Ceuta</span>, and had him still in
               his power, with other slaves who served the masons about the house which he was
               building: <span class="persName">Nisa</span>
               <span class="emotion" title="adj">glad</span> of this news, in the evening got on
               horseback, clothed in a scarlet casque, laid about with gold lace, having a hat upon
               her <span class="body">head</span> embroidered with pearl and a great feather, and a rich
               sword of Tunis hanging in a scarf by her side: in this manner she went into the
               street where <span class="persName">Sali Murat</span> dwelt, and saw (in a new house which
               was there being built) her <span class="emotion" title="adj">miserable</span> (but beloved)
               <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, not yet fully healed of his wounds, having a poor
               doublet of course canvas and breeches of the same, without shoes upon his <span class="body">feet</span>, and carrying with another Christian the materials wherewith
               that house was to be built; she stayed not (as she had thought) because that seeing
               him in this state, the tears which she shed would have revealed her; but feigning
               to
               turn her horse in the street, and the beams of her <span class="body">face</span>
               properly resembling them of the sun having scattered the clouds of this water, she
               stayed looking upon these slaves, and said unto <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> in
               the language of <span class="placeName">Fez</span>, why doth Murat build this fair house,
               having another in this street so fair? <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> answered
               (according to his knowledge) that they were for the keeping of slaves, because that
               since his good success in the former war he was grown <span class="emotion" title="adj">proud</span>, and did presage that he should have many. Thou art then his slave,
               said she, in the Castilian <span class="body">tongue</span>.
               <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> answered that by his misfortune he was brought to
               that estate, and earnestly beholding her <span class="body">face</span>, let fall to the
               ground that which he held in his <span class="body">hand</span>, wondering to see a Moor
               which should so perfectly resemble his beloved <span class="persName">Nisa</span>: for that
               this should be she, he could not persuade himself, by reason of her language, her
               habit and the small time since that he left her in <span class="placeName">Ceuta</span>: so
               he remained without speaking, endeavouring to cover his <span class="emotion" title="noun">astonishment</span> and confusion by his silence, when as she speaking to
               him in the Arabian <span class="body">tongue</span> asked of him if he were a knight?
               <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> more assured that it was <span class="persName">Nisa</span>,
               by the resemblance of her <span class="body">face</span>, and distrusting it was not she
               by her language, hearing her speak the language of <span class="placeName">Fez</span> so
               naturally, answered her. I told <span class="persName">Sali Murat</span> that I was a poor
               man, but because you resemble so much a master which heretofore I had (unto whom I
               never lied in my life) I will not deceive you. I am a Castilian Knight, and of the
               Kingdom of <span class="placeName">Toledo</span>, and of a place whereof it is not possible
               but you should have heard, because that the names of prince’s courts are notorious
               to all nations, as <span class="placeName">Paris</span> in <span class="placeName">France</span>,
               <span class="placeName">Rome</span> in <span class="placeName">Italy</span>,
               <span class="placeName">Constantinople</span> in <span class="placeName">Greece</span> and
               <span class="placeName">Madrid</span> in <span class="placeName">Spain</span>; there was I born,
               subject unto this misfortune wherein you see me. But gentle Moor, I pray tell me,
               who you are and why you ask of me my country and my quality? I am, said
               <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, nephew to the governor <span class="persName">Ali Japha</span>,
               and son to <span class="persName">Muley Nuzan</span> his brother, by a Christian slave who
               was born in <span class="placeName">Toledo</span>: my name is <span class="persName">Hassan
                  Rubin</span>, although that heretofore I called myself by my mother’s name,
               <span class="persName">Mendoza</span>: my uncle’s son being dead, he sent for me to
               <span class="placeName">Morocco</span>, the place of my birth, from whence he brought me
               hither, and to comfort himself called me by the name of his son; promising me to
               marry me unto <span class="persName">Leila Acha</span> his daughter, who is the fairest in
               all <span class="placeName">Africa</span>, and this is the reason which inciteth me to <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> Christians (who are well born) because my
               mother was one; especially Spaniards and of her own country: and it grieves me
               extremely that thou art belonging to this governor, who is reputed to use his slaves
               hardly, as it may be seen by experience in thyself, who being such that thy nobility
               doth manifestly appear, notwithstanding the <span class="emotion" title="noun">misery</span> and poverty of thy clothes, yet doth put thee to such vile labour.
               Wherefore as well because thou pleasest me well as for the reasons which I have told
               thee, I will bring it to pass, if thou think good of it, that <span class="persName">Ali
                  Japha</span> shall buy thee, and in his house there shall be nothing wanting
               unto thee but thy liberty; as for all other things I will use thee as myself.
               <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> at these words cast himself at her <span class="body">feet</span>, and by force did many times kiss them, thanking her for the favour
               which she did him.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">So being departed, <span class="persName">Nisa</span> told <span class="persName">Ali Japha</span>
               the <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> which she had unto a Spanish slave who
               was evil entreated of <span class="persName">Sali Murat</span>; the Moor, who desired to
               oblige him absolutely and to satisfy his <span class="emotion" title="noun">pleasure</span>
               in all things, went the next morning to <span class="persName">Sali Murat</span>; to treat
               with him about the sale of this slave; which being not refused unto him, they talked
               of the price: Sali demanded a thousand ducats, because (sayeth he) he had been taken
               in good equipage, both for <span class="body">arms</span> and horse, and a red scarf upon
               his left<span class="body">arm</span> a thing which (he said) in the time of his being in
               <span class="placeName">Spain</span> he had seen in kings’ portraitures:
               <span class="persName">Nisa</span> who was most interested at the bargain said to him that
               in <span class="placeName">Spain</span> clothes were common, and the pride of soldiers equal
               to the majesty of their princes: In the end they agreed upon five hundred ducats,
               and <span class="persName">Nisa</span> going to the chamber where
               <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> lay, took him along with her; he filled with tears,
               and imaginations, attributing this kindness to the resemblance which was between the
               Moor and <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, and oftentimes he resolved to believe that it
               was she; for although the habit and <span class="body">tongue</span> disguised her, yet
               the voice and countenance revealed her. She lodged him in a place differing and
               better than that of the slaves: she caused him incontinently to be clothed, and
               going to see him the first night, she brought him one of her smocks, entreating him
               to wear it under his: <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> cast himself at her <span class="body">feet</span>, and <span class="persName">Nisa</span> turning herself away, he
               humbly kissed the ground which she had trodden upon. But they had not long talked
               together when <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> grew so certain that if she was not
               <span class="persName">Nisa</span> he was <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span>; that
               thereby he could not sleep, he could not eat nor do any other thing but show her his
               thoughts in the violence of sighs: <span class="persName">Nisa</span>
               <span class="emotion" title="verb">fearing</span> that in this perplexity he might lose his
               wits, to assure him and thereby to know the secret of his <span class="body">heart</span>, uttered these words one day to him; <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> the
               <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> which I bear thee constrained me to
               procure thy good, and to solicit thy rest: I told <span class="persName">Ali Japha</span>
               that I stood much affected unto thee, and he answered me, that if I wished he would
               send thee into thy country, that thou shouldst go upon thy word, and that from
               thence thou shouldst upon thy honour, send him that which thou owest him. But I who
               lose my life in losing thee have entreated him to give thee my sister
               <span class="persName">Fatima</span> to wife, and that thereby I doubted not but I should
               persuade thee to alter thy religion and become a Moor; If thou canst bee contented
               to do this for me I shall know thy gentleness, and thou shalt enjoy the most
               beautiful gentlewoman in all <span class="placeName">Morocco</span>, and shalt be one of the
               richest men of all <span class="placeName">Africa</span>, because that besides what my
               father left her, my uncle will give her a great part of his estate also, and I will
               give thee mine, and my wife and I will sojourn under thy government.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose"><span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, whose intent was to make her reveal herself unto
               him, or else to nettle <span class="persName">Nisa</span> so far as that she should declare
               herself, coldly answered, that to obey her, and to requite the duty which he owed
               her, he would willingly become a Moor; as well for that reason, as also that he had
               seen <span class="persName">Fatima</span> sometimes in the baths; of whom he was grown so <span class="emotion" title="adj">amorous</span> that the little <span class="emotion" title="noun">pleasure</span> and less health which he had, proceeded from thence.
               Hardly had <span class="persName">Nisa</span> heard <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’
               resolution when in an extreme <span class="emotion" title="noun">fury</span> she said unto
               him, Ah perfidious traitor and barbarous enemy: without God, without faith, without
               love, without loyalty; is this that which thou owest unto heaven, to thy parents,
               to
               thy country and to the unfortunate and miserable <span class="persName">Nisa</span>? Who to
               deliver thee hath put herself into such great dangers? I knew well my most beloved
               <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, answered <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> (embracing her)
               that this subtlety was necessary, for to make thee reveal thine; for thou governest
               thyself in such manner that before thou wouldst have otherwise plainly declared
               thyself to me, I should have lost my wits, if not my life. Let go my<span class="body">arm</span> ungrateful wretch, said <span class="persName">Nisa</span>; use no more these
               subtleties, having discovered so much perfidious weakness; but wretch that I am, why
               do I complain? Seeing that he who forsaketh God doth not injure me in forsaking me:
               but in the end after many <span class="emotion" title="adj">sorrowful</span> complaints,
               his satisfactions had such virtue that her <span class="emotion" title="noun">anger</span>
               being overcome by her <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, they remained
               friends, with more <span class="emotion" title="noun">pleasure</span> and firmness than
               ever, as it always happens between true lovers.<br /></p>
            
            <p class="prose">This day passed away, followed with many others, during which time they entered
               into deliberations of the means whereby they might recover their liberty; which
               seemed to them impossible in respect of the <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>
               which <span class="persName">Ali Japha</span> bore unto <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, as also in
               respect of the<span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>which
               <span class="persName">Fatima</span> bore unto <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>; for she
               having heard that he would be a Moor and that his uncle would marry her to him,
               favoured him, to <span class="persName">Nisa</span>’s great <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span> who upon this <span class="emotion" title="noun">jealousy</span> was for the
               space of three months without any loving correspondence with him: Behold an unheard
               of story! Wherein is to be seen what a woman (who loveth) can effect; seeing she
               deceived the distrust of an old Moor, and brought all his house to that point that
               all things were governed by the only will of <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>: who
               taking better counsel, whilst <span class="persName">Ali Japha</span> was gone to Taroudant
               where the king lay at that time, wrought so handsomely with <span class="persName">Acha
                  </span>and <span class="persName">Fatima</span> that they would go into
               <span class="placeName">Spain</span> with him, upon the remonstrance which he made to them
               that his<span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>was certain and assured, and theirs
               deceitful, false and not to be believed: they were not hard to be persuaded, because
               they were women, Moors, and lovers; three things of a lesser resistance. So one fair
               night, having packed up all the best jewels they could find, they got all four to
               horseback, and <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> being clad in the like apparel unto
               <span class="persName">Nisa</span> that thereby they might pass more surely, they came unto
               <span class="placeName">Ceuta</span>, where being <span class="emotion" title="adverb">joyfully</span> received by the General, he accommodated them with shipping for
               <span class="placeName">Lisbon</span>. There he let <span class="persName">Acha </span>and
               <span class="persName">Fatima</span> understand that it was necessary for them to go to
               <span class="placeName">Rome</span>, that the chief and holy Pope might receive them into
               the Church, and pardon them himself: all which they did the sooner to get out of
               <span class="placeName">Spain</span>; they being <span class="emotion" title="adj">contented</span> to follow them wheresoever they would go, embarked themselves all
               together in a ship of <span class="placeName">Aragon, </span>which had brought in wheat, and
               having a fair wind they arrived in <span class="placeName">Sicily</span>, from whence
               because it was the year of Jubilee, they went all four in the habit of pilgrims to
               <span class="placeName">Rome</span>. There <span class="persName">Acha </span>and
               <span class="persName">Fatima</span> were baptized: <span class="persName">Acha </span>was called
               <span class="persName">Clementina</span> (of his Holiness’ name), and
               <span class="persName">Fatima</span> was called <span class="persName">Hippolyta</span>, from her
               godmother. The marriage was resting still, to be performed according to promise. But
               <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> and <span class="persName">Nisa</span> entertained them
               always with hope, remonstrating unto them that it was not fit nor just that they
               should be married before they came unto their father’s house. So after they had seen
               the great part of <span class="placeName">Italy</span> and <span class="placeName">France</span>,
               from thence they passed into <span class="placeName">Spain</span>, where they thought that
               <span class="persName">Nisa</span>’s parents’ <span class="emotion" title="noun">anger</span> was
               by this time over, for when thefts in <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> are
               not chastised upon the act in warm blood, they are always remitted with time. But
               having run a dangerous fortune in a <span class="emotion" title="adj">miserable</span>
               tartana into which they had embarked themselves at Villa Franca, and having been
               long beaten with a sore tempest, they finished their shipwreck within the sight of
               the walls of <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>, neither is known, whether
               <span class="persName">Nisa</span> and the Moors are alive or dead: but
               <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> swimming attained unto a plank of the ship, and
               within a day after, being taken up by some Moors of Bizerta, they carried him to
               <span class="placeName">Constantinople</span> where I saw him a captive, and where he told
               me what I have related.<br /></p>
            
            
            
         </div>
         
         
         <p class="prose">Thus <span class="persName">Nisa</span> added to the truth to hide herself from
            <span class="persName">Finia</span>, knowing already by that which was related in the first Book,
            how she and <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> were both taken up half drowned, one by the
            fishers and the other by captain <span class="persName">Doricles</span>, with their several
            successes in their peregrinations in <span class="placeName">Spain</span>, until they met together
            amongst the madmen in the hospital of <span class="placeName">Valencia</span>.
            <span class="persName">Finia</span> thanked her much for the news which she had told her of her
            brother, showing some <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span> for the death of
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>; afterwards having concluded their return into
            <span class="placeName">Spain</span>, they retired themselves together to
            <span class="placeName">Marseille</span>, where they rested for some days,
            <span class="persName">Finia</span> believing always that <span class="persName">Nisa</span> was this
            <span class="persName">Felix</span>, whose name she had borrowed.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">In the meantime, <span class="emotion" title="adj">miserable</span>
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> suffered in prison with more rigorous pain than he did
            before, because that his <span class="emotion" title="noun">fury</span> increasing with his <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span> he was kept so much the more straitly, by how much
            he was thought to be the more <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span>. In the end
            <span class="persName">Jacinth</span> came to <span class="placeName">Valencia</span> and being
            advertised by <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> of his misfortune, he drew him out of the
            cage, and had him to his house, saying that his parents had sent him five hundred
            crowns
            of <span class="placeName">Castile</span> to defray the charge of his cure at home. All those who
            remained in the hospital were sorry, because until that time, there was never seen
            a
            madman so wise, nor a wise man which did imagine so many follies. There did
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> take again his ancient habit, and being departed from
            <span class="persName">Jacinth</span> and his sister, (in whom the wonderfulness of his story
            raised no less<span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>than pity) took again the second time
            his way to <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>, where he was no sooner come but he was met
            and known, by one of those whom he had wounded in <span class="placeName">Montserrat</span>: he
            was then the second time laid in prison in the same place where the two Germans his
            companions had remained until that time. A thing worthy of admiration in any
            understanding, that a man should not be able to find the clue whereby he might get
            out of
            so many labyrinths; from <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span> to
            <span class="placeName">Valencia</span>, and from <span class="placeName">Valencia</span> to
            <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>, in journeying in a small part of his country, with
            more variable successes then <span class="persName">Aeneas</span> did in his voyage of
            <span class="placeName">Italy</span>, or <span class="persName">Ulysses</span> in that of
            <span class="placeName">Greece</span>. <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> saw there his friends with
            great <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span>, and was received by them with great <span class="emotion" title="noun">joy</span>. And <span class="persName">Finia</span> and
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span> coming from <span class="placeName">Marseille</span> little by little
            over the craggy mountains which divide <span class="placeName">France</span> from
            <span class="placeName">Spain</span>, came unto <span class="placeName">Perpignan</span>, where I leave

         <p class="prose">Great is <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> amongst the gods, and amongst men
            marvellous says <span class="persName">Phaedrus</span> in <span class="persName">Plato</span>:
            <span class="persName">Hesiod</span> says that the two first things which were seen after the

            other attributes, he calls it the God of Peace, the Father of Desire, and the Appetite
            of
            Good; in the presence of which the soul desires to be eternally: from whence it follows
            that <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> is a desire of immortality, which reconciles
            affections, gives goodwill, takes away hatred: of the nature of this <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> was that of our pilgrims, at the least <span class="persName">Nisa</span>'s,
            who being with <span class="persName">Finia</span> departed from <span class="placeName">Perpignan</span>,
            came with her into <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>, about that time when the sun having
            passed the middle of the day descends towards the West <span class="placeName">Indies</span>. But
            fortune not yet <span class="emotion" title="adj">weary</span> with troubling and crossing them,
            showed her that the first travails were only to be <span class="emotion" title="verb">feared</span> in regard of those which were necessarily to follow: for as she entered
            with <span class="persName">Finia</span> into the city, a confused throng of people constrained
            them to stand in the middle of the street. <span class="persName">Nisa</span> was desirous to know
            upon what occasion such a world of people was assembled, and seeing an old man who
            related
            it unto others, with <span class="emotion" title="noun">pity</span>, she entreated him (out of
            courtesy) to tell her. It is (pilgrims my friends), said the old man, because there
            is a
            knight, a Castilian, going to have his <span class="body">head</span> cut off for killing an
            officer of justice, who would have apprehended him upon suspicion of theft, which
            he had
            not done, near unto <span class="placeName">Montserrat</span>, whether he was going in pilgrimage
            (as you peradventure may do). But besides the greatness of his crime, which is no
            less
            then rebellion, he was found to have in the hollow of his staff a sword longer then
            is
            permitted to be worn by the ordinances of this kingdom.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">I am much <span class="emotion" title="verb">grieved</span> at it, answered
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, for many reasons; and principally, because he is a Castilian;
            for as you may perceive by my <span class="body">tongue</span> this pilgrim and I are both
            Castilians: it would more grieve you (said the old man) if you saw his <span class="body">face</span> and his proportion, accompanied with such youth that he doth not seem to be
            two and twenty years complete. Can you tell this knight’s name, said
            <span class="persName">Finia</span>? One of my sons, said the old man, has been his Proctor, and
            he told me that he was called <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> de
            <span class="persName">Luxan</span>, born at <span class="placeName">Madrid</span>, which is a city
            sufficiently known throughout all the world. With a pale and deadly countenance did
            the
            two pilgrims behold one another, and bursting into tears as from two fountains, they
            embraced and fell down together. The good old man wondering to see them thus suddenly
            oppressed, knew that this knight’s name had pierced to their soul; and encouraging
            them as
            much as possibly he could, he retired them to the door of the next house, the better
            to
            avoid the throng of people which stayed at the rareness of the accident;
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span> and <span class="persName">Finia</span>, having some time bewailed the
            <span class="emotion" title="adj">miserable</span>
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, told the old man that he was their kinsman. Then came a
            man entering into the street, breaking through the press of the people with his horse:
            which moved <span class="persName">Nisa</span> to entreat the old man, to enquire what he was, and
            upon what occasion he made such haste through the company? Who being informed, and
            coming
            again, demanded a reward for the good news which he brought. Hath
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> his pardon, said <span class="persName">Finia</span>? He whom you
            saw pass by, answered the old man, is a knight of <span class="placeName">Valencia</span>, called
            <span class="persName">Jacinth</span> Centellas, who coming the other day into this town upon
            some occasion, knew <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, and withal understanding he was
            condemned to die, told the Viceroy that this criminal person was a madman, and but
            newly
            gotten out of the hospital of <span class="placeName">Valencia</span>, as he offered to verify:
            whereupon the Viceroy and the Judge, willing to save this young man, suspended the
            execution of his judgement, and gave commission to this knight to bring proof of his
            affection; so much the rather believing his words by how much
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> confessed his crime and <span class="emotion" title="verb">desired</span> to die, with an extreme grief: but the time expiring (which was given to
            <span class="persName">Jacinth</span>) for the verifying of <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’
            madness, he was going towards the place of his execution, and by the way, is met by
            <span class="persName">Jacinth</span> (as you have seen) who hath brought with him sufficient
            proof and an express command from the Viceroy that he shall be taken back again to
            <span class="placeName">Valencia</span>.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">This news revived <span class="persName">Nisa</span> and <span class="persName">Finia</span>, who having
            rested themselves there all that day went the next day to see him in the prison; at
            the
            entrance whereof they found, that for a madman he was taken out and set upon a mule,
            to be
            carried to <span class="placeName">Valencia</span>. And even upon the instant that
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> lifting up his <span class="body">eyes</span> beheld his dear
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, and that she advanced herself to speak to him, came one of
            the servants and apprehended <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, and his companions seizing upon
            <span class="persName">Finia</span> put them both in prison: although
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> cried out that she was his brother, for being accounted
            for a madman he was not hearkened to, but contrariwise because he <span class="emotion" title="adverb">passionately</span> cast himself from his mule upon the ground, he was with
            much cruelty tied upon his mule’s back, and with shrewd blows set forward in his way;
            their opinion of his madness being the more confirmed.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">I cannot forbear wondering every time I think of this man’s misfortunes! He came first
            to
            <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span> to suffer at <span class="placeName">Valencia</span> all those
            miseries which you have formerly heard. And now it seems he returns that way again
            anew to
            begin the same pains. The cause of <span class="persName">Finia</span>'s and
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>'s apprehension was that <span class="persName">Nisa</span> in regard of
            his apparel and of his short <span class="body">hair</span> was thought to be a man, and being
            always in <span class="persName">Finia</span>'s company, the Justice took hold of them out of a
            strong suspicion that they did live lewdly and incontinently together, a thing which
            is
            often covered under the cloak of pilgrimage, which makes it more odious and frequent
            in
            that country. Whatsoever might happen of it, <span class="persName">Nisa</span> would not reveal
            herself notwithstanding any <span class="emotion" title="noun">fear</span> of chastisement: but
            defending her cause as a man, denied that ever she had so much as spoken otherwise
            than
            with great honesty and modesty to <span class="persName">Finia</span>. Who accounting
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span> for a man, and believing certainly that she was the same
            <span class="persName">Felix</span> whom she feigned to be, with whose conversation and beauty
            she was charmed, confessed simply her <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> (for the
            effect was impossible) and although the honesty of their conversation did appear by
            both
            their confessions, yet their beauty was a cruel witness against their innocence.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">About this time came the afflicted <span class="persName">Celio</span> (by the mountains of
            <span class="placeName">France</span>, the principal cities whereof he had sought for his
            beloved <span class="persName">Finia</span>) back to <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>, still
            continuing his quest, and only to inform himself if there were any pilgrims of
            <span class="placeName">Castile</span>; and having understood that there were two prisoners but
            a few days before he went to see them, hoping to hear some news, if not of
            <span class="persName">Finia</span>, at least of the country. His fortune would that he should
            first meet with her before he saw his Sister <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, and being
            advertised that see had been taken with a young man, and laid up for the suspicion
            that
            was had of their dishonest <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, he spoke to her
            through an iron grate, which separates the men’s Prisons from the women’s.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">Is this O <span class="persName">Finia</span>, the confidence which I had of thy virtue so
            conformable to the nobleness of thy blood? Is it here (after having searched thee
            almost
            all <span class="placeName">France</span> over, having measured step by step all the tedious
            plains and craggy mountains which did lead unto any place where there was either hope
            or
            likelihood to find thee, undergoing many notable dangers) that I should think to find
            thee
            in a public prison with a young man? Now are all my suspicions confirmed, and my reasons
            that I had to kill the Frenchman, for which I have suffered so many travails: Is this
            the
            recompense of so many evils, which for thy sake I have endured? Dost thou thus requite
            thy
            obligations to me? At the least this comfort I have, I may return into my country
            with
            full assurance that I shall not incur any infamy, neither in thy friend’s opinion
            nor in
            mine own: for having left thee in this danger, and in those which will inevitably
            follow
            thee, seeing thou hast found another who accompanies thee, honours thee and defends
            thee.
            Think not, O ungrateful person, answered <span class="persName">Finia</span> in weeping, that I
            have ever offended thee, for thou canst not make me suffer so much that I would hazard
            that which thou hast cost me, for all the treasure of the world: thy <span class="emotion" title="noun">jealousy</span> made thee kill a man and leave me alone in such a place; the
            difficulty of getting away from whence, considering my weakness, may seem a miracle.
            In my
            voyage I have met with this man, who no less innocent then chaste Joseph, suffers
            this
            unjust imprisonment for having been the most honest helper that I could have <span class="emotion" title="verb">desired</span> in thy absence, as thou may plainly see by the
            modesty of his countenance and his speech, if thou please to speak with him. To excuse
            thyself, answered <span class="persName">Celio</span>, in so notorious a crime, is to move me to
            greater <span class="emotion" title="noun">anger</span>, because thou may have failed as a woman,
            but to deny it to me and to say that thou hast not done it, is a most evident token
            that
            thou wilt deceive me either here or in thy own country (if ever thou return thither)
            therefore I do forbid thee for ever to dare to name me or to say thou ever knew me.
            So
            said <span class="persName">Celio</span>, and turning his <span class="body">back</span> to
            <span class="persName">Finia</span> left her in the greatest <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span> that a woman could suffer; which is in these accidents to lose his presence
            under whose protection she lives: especially when it seems to her that she cannot
            hope for
            any other remedy or succour. <span class="persName">Celio</span> hiding the tears which he shed in
            going away, and consulting with the <span class="emotion" title="noun">fury</span> of his <span class="emotion" title="noun">jealousy</span>, and his <span class="emotion" title="noun">rage</span>
            for the injury which he did think he had received, concerning the revenge which he
            should
            take, waited for <span class="persName">Nisa</span>'s enlargement, that he might kill him. The
            judges although that the prisoner’s innocence did sufficiently appear, yet would not
            give
            them liberty to return together (for those do seem to permit the evil, which do not
            forbid
            the occasion) but retired <span class="persName">Finia</span> into a house and commanded
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span> whom they called <span class="persName">Felix</span>, that that day he
            should leave the city of <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>. <span class="persName">Nisa</span> went
            then late in the evening out of the town, and far from thinking that her brother waited
            to
            kill her, believing her to be the man with whom <span class="persName">Finia</span> had so
            irreconcilably offended him: and the darkness of the evening with the disguise of
            man’s
            apparel which <span class="persName">Nisa</span> wore deprived <span class="persName">Celio</span>'s <span class="body">eyes</span>, (already blinded with anger) from discerning her to be his sister
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, into whose<span class="body">body</span>he twice thrust his sword,
            and had absolutely killed her if some passengers upon the way at that time had not,
            not
            only hindered him, but also apprehended him and put him in prison.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">The <span class="emotion" title="adj">miserable</span>
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, who then began to have a greater feeling of her suffered
            miseries, was carried to an honourable citizen’s house of great compassion and charity,
            who having given order for her dressing and found that her wounds were not mortal,
            pursued
            <span class="persName">Celio</span> so eagerly in justice, informing the judges of the crime
            which he himself had seen him commit, that the third day after he was condemned to
            death.
            <span class="persName">Celio</span> alleged in his defence that <span class="persName">Finia</span> was
            his lawful wife, and that having found her imprisoned with this young man for suspicion
            of
            incontinency, he did not think that he had done evil if he had killed them both. Whereupon
            they ordered that <span class="persName">Finia</span> should be imprisoned again; but she having
            some notice thereof, prevented it by flight.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">On the other side, <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> coming to
            <span class="placeName">Valencia</span> recovered his liberty by <span class="persName">Jacinth</span>’s
            means; with an extreme <span class="emotion" title="noun">contentment</span> to
            <span class="persName">Tiberia</span>, unto whom <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> giving thanks for
            the care which she had of him, raised in her a thousand hopes which his absence and
            <span class="emotion" title="noun">misery</span> had killed. He took leave of her with many fair
            and <span class="emotion" title="adj">amorous</span> words, and returning to
            <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>, went to seek for his dear <span class="persName">Nisa</span> in
            the prison wherein he had seen her shut when he went away as a madman. But when he
            found
            <span class="persName">Celio</span> there in her place, in such extreme danger of his life, from
            whom (informing him of the cause of his misfortune) he was told all the injury which
            <span class="persName">Finia</span> had done him with a pilgrim, whom he had wounded, whereby he
            came to know that this man whom <span class="persName">Celio</span> out of <span class="emotion" title="noun">jealousy</span> would have killed was his own sister <span class="persName">Nisa</span>.
            And with the <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span> of so <span class="emotion" title="adj">unhappy</span> a news, <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> cried out; O cruel
            <span class="persName">Celio</span>, thou hast taken away the life of thy own sister, and my dear
            wife, whom under this habit accompanied my fortunes: and it may be also my sister
            <span class="persName">Finia</span>, for whose sake thou hast unjustly killed
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>. I am <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> thy enemy, unto whom (not
            knowing of me) thou didst recite the story of thy fortunes, who have already pardoned
            the
            injury which thou hast done to my honour in ravishing away <span class="persName">Finia</span>,
            having consideration of the injury which I did thee in leading away
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">With less <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span> would <span class="persName">Celio</span> have
            heard the sentence of his death, than the relation which <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>
            made; for he remained so astonished and silent as if he had been taken out of prison
            to go
            to execution. He would have justified his innocence, but being not able to utter one
            word,
            he remained dumb, and his <span class="body">hands</span> and his <span class="body">feet</span>
            without any motion made him appear as one insensible. <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> as
            almost <span class="emotion" title="adj">mad</span>, left him in the prison, and going up and
            down to enquire for <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, he was accounted for a madman by all those
            who saw him, for they did remember that for a madman he was saved, being condemned
            to die.
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> having been three or four times at
            <span class="persName">Jacinth</span>’s house; <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, to work
            the greater confusion, had augmented his sister <span class="persName">Tiberia</span>'s <span class="emotion" title="verb">desires</span>; who (as you have heard) cast her <span class="body">eyes</span> upon <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’ beauty: he overcome with the good turns,
            and pitiful care which she had of his misfortunes, had not rigorously entreated her
            thoughts: she, when this last time she saw him return to <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>,
            and that neither her prayers nor entreaties could stay him; wrote to her brother (who
            did
            accompany him in his journey) how that <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, out of the lustful
            courage of an ungrateful guest, had so far forgotten himself as to make <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> to her, and that she, yielding to his persuasions had embarked
            herself with more sure gauges, than, without the bonds of marriage, did fit either
            with
            her honour or the reputation of either of them.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose"><span class="persName">Jacinth</span>, <span class="emotion" title="adj">angry</span> at this evil
            correspondence and ungrateful acknowledgement of his friendship, good turns and
            hospitality, sought <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> as earnestly as he sought
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, and having found him, led him out of the town upon the shore
            side, where he showed him his sister’s letter: afterwards (setting his <span class="body">hand</span> on his sword) he said he would wish him to draw his sword: now to offend him,
            that sword which formerly he had at <span class="placeName">Valencia</span>, drawn in his defence,
            although a treacherous fellow as he was did not deserve to have his sword measured
            with
            his. The innocent pilgrim excused himself, entreating him to let him search out
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, whom (he said) he had heard was sore wounded, and that he
            would not upon the lies and indiscretion of a <span class="emotion" title="verb">despised</span>
            woman hinder him in this business which did so nearly concern him as did the search
            for
            his dear wife, who was in danger of losing her life; and that he himself was the most
            assured witness to how much pain, labour and danger <span class="persName">Nisa</span> had cost
            him; and only thoughts of whom had kept him from taking <span class="emotion" title="noun">pleasure</span> in any other thing. These excuses did not satisfy
            <span class="persName">Jacinth</span>, because the opinion which he had concealed of his sister
            <span class="persName">Tiberia</span>'s virtues did darken in his understanding the light of all
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’ reason: who out of the many obligations against his
            honour and condition, suffered <span class="persName">Jacinth</span>’s injurious words. But in the
            end, seeing him threaten him with his sword in his <span class="body">hand</span>, calling him
            base coward, runagate, and many other insupportable insolences, he drew his sword
            to slay
            his enemies and with a point nimbly running upon him, overthrew him to the ground,
            if not
            dead, yet at least so near dead that he seemed so. <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> most
            grievously detesting his most outrageous fortune, took him in his <span class="body">arms</span> and carried him into the town, the one shedding his blood and the other his
            tears; and finding strong life in him, he persuaded him of the truth of his innocence,
            leaving him at a church door (whither the people flocked apace to see him, knowing
            that he
            was wounded). And without inquiring any further of <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, he went once
            again out of <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>, although much more <span class="emotion" title="adj">sad</span>; for he left his best friend whom he had sorely wounded with his own
            <span class="body">hand</span>, and his dearest friend near the <span class="body">hands</span> of
            death.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">Iber so called of <span class="placeName">Iberia</span>, an ancient river of that kingdom
            (sometimes very rich) not far from that place where <span class="persName">Scipio</span> vanquished
            the Carthaginians, and as <span class="persName">Titus Livius</span> affirms, joined
            <span class="placeName">Spain</span> to the <span class="placeName">Roman Empire</span>, running from
            two fountains, bathes the fields of the Cantabrians and the Celtiberians, taking its
            name
            from the Celts which came out of <span class="placeName">France</span>, and from the province of
            <span class="placeName">Iberia</span>, no less rich and fruitful than those which of the same
            name are called <span class="placeName">Iberia</span>n, near the mountain
            <span class="placeName">Caucasas</span>, having abundance of gold within their veins. This
            famous flood, according to <span class="persName">Pliny</span>, rises near to the ancient
            Iuliobriga, and after many windings and turnings comes to wash the walls of Sallibinum,
            which <span class="persName">Caesar</span> called <span class="persName">Caesar</span> Augustus, and the
            injury of times <span class="placeName">Saragossa</span>.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">At the course of these crystalline waters <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> stayed his
            flight, sitting down upon the bank of the river, which began to swell with his tears,
            so
            <span class="emotion" title="adj">pitiful</span> to behold, that the very winds did seem to
            condole with him in his complaints by their doleful noise, amongst the leaves of the
            trees, and the birds warbling out their woes. There was not anything of life which
            had not
            some show of sorrow with him, unless it were the fishes, which being dumb did not
            put
            forth their <span class="body">head</span>s out of their clear waters at the importunity of
            other voices, yet their silence did seem to join with him in sorrow. Is it possible
            said
            he, that the <span class="emotion" title="noun">fear</span> of losing this unprofitable life
            should have more power over me than the duties which I owe to my birth and to my mistress?
            How comes it to pass that not to lose a thing, so vile in my <span class="body">eyes</span>, so
            heavy to my soul and so grievous to my suffering, I have lost the most esteemed of
            my
            understanding, the most honoured of my memory and the most adored of my will? It is
            thou
            fair <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, who over the sharp mountains of
            <span class="placeName">Toledo</span> didst courageously follow my steps, from their highest
            tops even to the sands of the <span class="placeName">Spanish Sea</span>: thou art she, who in the
            battle of <span class="placeName">Ceuta</span> didst <span class="emotion" title="adverb">bitterly</span>
            bewail my captivity: art not thou o my dear <span class="persName">Nisa</span> she who under the
            habit of a Moor and under the name of <span class="persName">Hassan Rubin</span>, drew me from the
            Kingdom of <span class="placeName">Fez</span>, and from the captivity of Sali Morata? Wert not
            thou cast away with me at sea, in our return from <span class="placeName">Italy</span> within the
            view of <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>’s walls, and whom the sea cast up on the shore,
            as unworthy to possess so rich a pearl? Didst not thou live afterwards a long time
            amongst
            the madmen as deprived of thy reason, with the very <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span> of my Death? Didst not thou suffer new shipwreck at
            <span class="placeName">Marseille</span>? And finally wounded by thy <span class="emotion" title="adj">jealous</span> brother lie now in a strange country, either sick or dead? Seeing
            all this is so, how can I apprehend the least notion of leaving thee? Where is my
            courage,
            or am I not <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> of <span class="persName">Luxan</span>? Is this the
            virtuous blood of those valiant governors, who so nobly defended the walls of
            <span class="placeName">Madrid</span> from the Moors of <span class="placeName">Toledo</span>? It is not
            possible! I am not myself, my misfortunes have changed me into something else. To
            be in
            <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> and to be a coward is a manifest contrariety:
            yet to deny that I <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> is to say the sun is darkness
            and the night light, especially since I cannot say but that I have seen
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>. But seeing I do confess that I have seen her, how can I say
            but that I <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> her? And if I <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> her, how can I leave her? And if I have left her, wherefore do I
            live?<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">So did <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> accuse himself for having left
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span> for any danger; no more nor no less than as one who travailing
            upon the way remembers something of importance which he had forgotten at home, breaking
            off from his discourse and from his company, turns back again to his lodging where
            he
            thinks he shall never come time enough; with the same haste <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>
            makes his way back again to <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>, from which both in haste and
            <span class="emotion" title="noun">fear</span> he had departed. A strong chain of lovers, which
            tied to their <span class="emotion" title="verb">desired</span> beauty, shortens itself by the
            force which lengthens it, until it returns to its centre. Beauty without doubt, which
            lifting up the vapours of the lovers’ <span class="body">eyes</span>, seems to draw unto itself
            the very weighty and earthy part, despite all resistance made by the natural weight,
            and
            as the sun oftentimes converts into burning beams the humour which is concealed in
            the
            clouds, so beauty converts into fire all the tears and <span class="emotion" title="noun">sadness</span> of lovers.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">Few leagues had <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> journ<span class="body">eye</span>d from the
            famous colony of the Romans when as going down a hill, it being so late that the sun
            had
            left no light in the west, but as it were a golden girdle; which environing the horizon
            did seem as a crown unto the neighbouring night: he heard a voice grievously complaining
            in a meadow, which shadowed with high rocks, was very dark.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">The courageous pilgrim went into it, and saw a man lying upon the grass amongst the
            trees
            which were watered with a fresh brook, of whom demanding the cause of his complaint,
            he
            entreated him to come to him, if he <span class="emotion" title="verb">desired</span> to know,
            before he yielded up his soul, caused by three mortal wounds which were made in his
            <span class="body">body</span>. <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> approached him although with some
            distrust, and lifting him up leaned his <span class="body">head</span> against a tree. I am a
            knight, said the wounded man; treacherously murdered by his <span class="body">hands</span> who
            hath received most good turns from me; there is a monastery in these fields which
            is not
            far from hence, if thou canst carry me on thy <span class="body">shoulders</span> thither, thou
            shalt bee the <span class="persName">Aeneas</span> of my soul, and I the Anchises, saved
            peradventure from the eternal fire which I have merited. <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>
            laid down his palmer’s staff (oh how hurtful it is to leave one’s weapons upon any
            occasion whatsoever) taking him in his <span class="body">arms</span>; and remembering that he
            had so carried <span class="persName">Jacinth</span>, he thought to himself, that seeing he was
            come to carry others to the grave, he was not far from thence himself: and comforted
            himself with this, that if he were not Death himself, he was yet his bier. So journeying
            towards the monastery with the wounded man, who with broken speeches interrupted by
            his
            approaching death, recited the cause thereof. The pilgrim being come to the gate,
            and
            seeing by the clear light of the moon, in the front thereof, the image of our Blessed
            Lady
            the Virgin, said to the wounded man that he should recommend his soul whilst he knocked
            at
            the gate. At whose knocking the porter being come, and informed by the pilgrim of
            the
            accident, answered that with like dissimulation, certain bandoleers of Jara had one
            night
            robbed the monastery, and for that cause he could not open the gate without the superior’s
            license. <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> entreated him to dispatch: but there being a long
            garden between the monastery and cell, before he could return the knight died in his
            <span class="body">arms</span>.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose"><span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> looked pale, dismayed with the accident, and almost as
            dead as he, and encouraging him to this <span class="emotion" title="adj">fearful</span> and
            sharp passage, laid a cross of two myrtle boughs on his <span class="body">stomach</span>.
            Instantly he heard a troop of horse, whose masters being divided into divers paths,
            did
            seek for the dead man. By their words and their diligence, the pilgrim knew their
            design,
            and calling them, showed them him whom they sought for, telling them how he had found
            him.
            Amongst them was his brother, who seeing <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> bloody, and in a
            pilgrim’s habit (which is enough to make an honest man suspected) cried out, Oh thou
            Castilian traitor, thou hast murdered him to rob him. And at the very instant, the
            same
            friend who had killed this poor knight, and who the better to cover his treason,
            accompanying the brother, took hold of the pilgrim’s<span class="body">arm</span> thou robber
            and infamous assassin, what hath made thee murder the noblest knight in this country?
            Sirs, replied <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, I found him in a meadow hard by, bewailing
            his death, which he said was wrought by the <span class="body">hand</span> of one whom he did
            account his best friend: and out of compassion and at his entreaty, I brought him
            to this
            monastery, where he departed this life in my <span class="body">arms</span>. But
            <span class="persName">Tansiles</span> (who was the traitor which had killed him) fearing lest
            the pilgrim might discover something which he might have heard from the dying man
            concerning his treason, pulling out a pistol from the pommel of his saddle, gave fire
            and
            aimed it directly at his <span class="body">head</span>. Yet heaven not permitting that it
            should go off (for saints and angels do always assist the innocent) the pilgrim lived.
            O
            let him live said <span class="persName">Tirsus</span>, (so was the dead man’s brother called) for
            it is much better, that keeping him in prison he may confess his own crime: and whether
            he
            killed him for to rob him, or whether some enemy of my brother
            <span class="persName">Godfrey</span>’s did not hire him to murder him. The traitor answered to
            <span class="persName">Tirsus</span> and to the others who did accompany him, that blood (yet
            warm) of his friend would not suffer him to delay his revenge so long. Yet all their
            opinions prevailing against his: the innocent <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> was bound <span class="body">hand</span> and <span class="body">foot</span> on a horse, and dead
            <span class="persName">Godfrey</span> laid on another. It is a just judgment, said
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> (by the way) for my leaving of <span class="persName">Nisa</span>
            wounded, and <span class="persName">Jacinth</span> almost dead. Do you not hear, said
            <span class="persName">Tirsus</span>? Without doubt this <span class="persName">Nisa</span> is the woman
            for whose sake he hath committed this murder, and <span class="persName">Jacinth</span> some friend
            who led my brother to the place. All of them believed what <span class="persName">Tirsus</span>
            said, and the traitor <span class="persName">Tansiles</span> interpreted
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’ <span class="emotion" title="noun">despair</span> in such sort,
            that everyone believed that <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> did speak of
            <span class="persName">Godfrey</span>’s death.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">They led him into no town as he thought they would, but to a grange house, about half
            a
            league from the monastery, the gate whereof was between two towers.
            <span class="persName">Tirsus</span> knocked, and a servant answered: tell my mother and sisters
            (said he) that I have brought my brother <span class="persName">Godfrey</span> dead, and his
            murderer with him. Instantly he heard a great cry in the hall of the house, by which
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> did know that fortune prepared a great deal of evil for
            him: Nevertheless desiring to die, he resolved not to defend his life with his <span class="body">tongue</span>, which he could not do with his <span class="body">arms</span>.
            Someone opened the door of the house, and with candles lighted the <span class="emotion" title="adj">miserable</span> mother with her daughters and servants received her dead son.
            Some howling and crying carried him into the hall, others ran upon poor
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, tearing his beard and pulling him by the <span class="body">hair</span> of the <span class="body">head</span>, and almost stunned him with blows. With
            this good entertainment he was lodged this night in one of the towers, having his<span class="body">body</span>laden with irons, yet he was heard to utter no words but only that
            he deserved this and more for forsaking <span class="persName">Nisa</span>. All this night nothing
            was heard but cries and complaints for <span class="persName">Godfrey</span>, and the time which
            was not employed in this funereal exercise they spent in talking of
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span> and what she should be, whom their prisoner had so often in
            his <span class="body">mouth</span>.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">The light of the morning, which very slowly enters into prisons, brought day to
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, not in waking him who had not slept, but in advertising
            his soul of his approaching death, the certain news whereof he would willingly have
            welcomed with gifts: when as the prison door being open, he saw
            <span class="persName">Godfrey</span>’s mother and sisters enter, demanding of him in great <span class="emotion" title="noun">passion</span> and choler, wherefore he had killed her son? But
            he answering, only for <span class="persName">Nisa</span>'s sake am I reduced to this <span class="emotion" title="noun">misery</span>, they began to beat him with such <span class="emotion" title="noun">rage</span> that they left him almost dead; and shutting the
            prison, they resolved to famish him to death. But whilst about noon, the dead<span class="body">body</span>was carried to burial, with lights, mourning and funeral company of
            his parents and friends: <span class="persName">Flerida</span> his youngest sister, mollified with
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’ complaints, were it that his countenance did enforce her
            to believe his innocence, or that some other secret sympathy inclined her to have
            <span class="emotion" title="noun">pity</span> of his life, went to the prison, and by the keyhole
            said thus to him: unfortunate pilgrim, do not afflict thyself, for I will free thee
            despite my mother and my brothers; who art thou, said <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> who
            promises life when there is nothing but heaven which can give it me? I am
            <span class="persName">Flerida</span> (answered she) one of <span class="persName">Godfrey</span>’s
            sisters who do promise it to thee, afflicted with thy <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span> out of the assurance I have in my own imagination of thy innocence.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">I swear unto thee by God said <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, that going in the night
            through a meadow I found thy brother wounded unto death, as he told me by one whom
            he did
            reckon to be his best friend; I took him on my <span class="body">shoulders</span>, and carried
            him to the monastery, where he died in my <span class="body">arms</span> before the gate was
            opened: I do not <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> to live, but the care which I
            have of another’s life more than mine own makes me seek my liberty contrary to my
            <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span>; if thou canst procure me it, I am a knight, and
            of a family from which ungrateful man nor traitor ever sprang: thou shalt do a heroic
            deed
            worthy of an illustrious lady, and though I should never merit it, yet heaven will
            not
            fail to acknowledge it. <span class="persName">Flerida</span> had not need of so many reasons, who
            was virtuous and so well disposed to free him, that she would hazard a thousand lives
            to
            give it to him. And (as aptly it served) those which were gone to accompany her
            brother’s<span class="body">body</span>to the grave, not being able to return speedily (as
            well in regard of the distance of the place, as in respect of the pomp of the funeral,
            which lasted nine days) gave her opportune means to open the planks on the top of
            the
            prison, thereby letting him down some vittles: all her other sisters, her mother and
            the
            servants only entered to torment him, they seeing him live, not knowing wherewith
            he did
            sustain himself, anger, indignation and cruelty increased so far in them that they
            resolved to kill him, before <span class="persName">Tirsus</span>’ return from the obsequies of his
            brother. But <span class="persName">Flerida</span> the same night gave him such strong files, that
            the fetters, staples and locks being cut asunder, and he being fastened to a cord,
            she
            drew him up by that hole which she had made by removing the planks; &amp; all the
            household being in their dead sleep, she opened the gates: afterwards, with honest
            embraces, shedding some tears and with many jewels which she did constrain him to
            take,
            she was departing from him, when he casting himself at her <span class="body">feet</span>, with
            the humblest words he could speak, promising to repay her this good turn with an immortal
            remembrance; and if that ever she had occasion to come into
            <span class="placeName">Castile</span>, she should enquire for a knight of
            <span class="placeName">Madrid</span> called <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> of
            <span class="persName">Luxan</span>, that she might be assured she should not return without
            due thanks and acknowledgements for so perfect an obligation.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose"><span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> knowing that to proceed further in the quest of
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span> was to resist the will of heaven, which had opposed him in it
            with so many rigorous successes, went to <span class="placeName">Saragossa</span>; resolving from
            thence to travel into <span class="placeName">Castile</span>. If thou didst not possess O
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span> (said he to himself as he went along) all my thought, and if
            thou didst not hold as much place in my<span class="body">body</span>as my soul does, which is
            all in every part; who would doubt, but <span class="persName">Flerida</span> should be now
            mistress of my will? O how powerful are good turns in apt occasions, seeing that the
            firmness of <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> which could not be moved with such
            painful travails, such <span class="emotion" title="adj">fearful</span> shipwrecks and with such
            cruel captivities and imprisonments, with one good turn alone in an opportune time,
            is
            shaken, if not mastered; at least the roof, if not the walls; and although the foundation
            be firm yet the windows and other ornaments do shake: let not those which shall hear
            this
            be displeased with him; for this was not so much a change from the <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> of <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, as a feeling of
            <span class="persName">Flerida</span>'s goodwill: and as there is nobody so solid which the sun
            sometime doth not pierce, so there is no <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> so firm
            but that the first motions thereof may shake.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose"><span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> so by long travail came to
            <span class="placeName">Saragossa</span>, and would not enter into it before it was dark night,
            for <span class="emotion" title="noun">fear</span> he might be followed or met by someone whom he
            knew: and very early in the morning departed from thence and by unused paths, from
            pasture
            to pasture, and from mountain to mountain, he endeavoured to shun the great highway,
            fearing that <span class="persName">Flerida</span>'s brother might make pursuit after him. In the
            end, wearied with the sharpness of the mountains and the austerity of the life which
            he
            was constrained to lead, he resolved one night to lie in some place where he might
            be
            better accommodated than in these deserts, and entering into a city which divides
            the two
            kingdoms, he enquired for a lodging. But nobody being willing to entertain him, seeing
            him
            so evilly apparelled, his <span class="body">feet</span> bloody, his <span class="body">face</span>
            tanned, his <span class="body">hair</span> knotted and shagged, he went to the hospital, the
            last refuge of <span class="emotion" title="noun">misery</span>. <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>
            found the gates open at that time, but without light, and asking the cause, he was
            told
            that in regard of a strange noise which every night was there heard, which had happened
            ever since the death of a stranger who came thither to lodge, nobody had dwelt there;
            yet
            he might (as they said) enter in if he would, for he should find there a man of holy
            life
            in a little chapel, who endured for the honour of God all those illusions, and who
            would
            show him a place where he might lie without danger. <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> then
            entered into a dark obscure place, and after some few steps saw a great way off a
            dim
            light of a lamp, to which place he addressed himself, and called the holy man. What
            wouldst thou have, thou wicked spirit? answered the holy man. Thou dost mistake me
            said
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, I am a pilgrim, who endeavours to seek a lodging for
            this night. Then he opened the door, where <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> saw a man of a
            middle stature and age, with a long beard and <span class="body">hair</span>, a gown of coarse
            cloth down to his <span class="body">ankles</span>. The chapel was little with an old altar,
            the base whereof did serve him for his bed: he had a stone for his pillow, his staff
            for
            his companion, and a death’s <span class="body">head</span> for his looking-glass.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">How durst thou come into this place, said he to the pilgrim, did no man advertise
            thee of
            the disquiet lodging which is here? I have been told it, answered the pilgrim, but
            I have
            suffered so much labour in my travels, so much cruelty in imprisonments, so many heavy
            misfortunes and cold entertainments, that no disquiet can be new to me. The poor man
            then
            lighted a candle at the lamp which burned before the altar, and without saying anything
            commanded the pilgrim to follow him; he went through a garden, which lay wild as a
            forest
            or wilderness, where having showed him a part of the house, amongst some cypress trees
            he
            unlocked the door of a chamber, and said to him, seeing thou art young and accustomed
            to
            travails, enter here: make the sign of the cross and be not dismayed nor astonished,
            but
            sleep; <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> took the candle, and setting it on a stone which lay
            there, bade his host good night and shut the door.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">There was a bed in the chamber good enough to rest on, especially for a man who hath
            lain
            so many nights on the ground: this invited him to unclothe himself, and taking one
            of the
            shirts which <span class="persName">Flerida</span> at his departure had given him, he put it on and
            got into the bed. Hardly had he revolved in his imagination the confusion of his life,
            a
            thing which often (the<span class="body">body</span>being at rest) is represented to the mind,
            when as sleep which is truly called the image and brother of Death, possessed his
            senses
            with that force which it is accustomed to use on <span class="emotion" title="adj">weary</span>
            pilgrims. All that part, which the sun abandons when it goes down to the
            <span class="placeName">Indies</span> was in a deep silence, when the noise of some horses
            awaked <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>. He thought he was stirring (as many times happens
            to travellers) and that his bed did move as if a ship or a horse was to carry him.
            Nevertheless remembering that he was in the hospital, and the causes for which it
            was
            uninhabitable, he opened his <span class="body">eyes</span>. He saw horsemen enter by two and
            two into the chamber, who lighting torches which they had in their <span class="body">hands</span> at the candle which he had left burning by him, they cast them against the
            ceiling of the chamber, where they stuck fast with their <span class="body">bottoms</span>
            upward and their tops downwards, which dropped down burning flames on his bed and
            on his
            clothes. He covered himself as well as possibly he could, leaving a little hole to
            look
            out that he might see whether his bed did burn or no; when as instantly he saw the
            flames
            go out, and that on a table which was in the corner of the chamber, four of them were
            playing at primero. They passed, discarded, and set up money as if they had truly
            played:
            so long till at length they debating upon a difference, they fell into quarrel in
            the
            chamber, which made such a noise with clashing of swords that the <span class="emotion" title="adj">miserable</span>
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> called on (for help) our Lady of
            <span class="placeName">Guadalupe</span>, which was only left (of all the shrines in
            <span class="placeName">Spain</span>) unvisited, although it were in his own country of
            <span class="placeName">Toledo</span>. Because holy places near to one are many times left
            unvisited out of a hope which is had, that they might be visited at any time. Nevertheless
            the clattering of the swords and all other noise for the space of half an hour ceased,
            and
            he was all of a sweat out of the very fear he had; yet no sooner was he well satisfied
            to
            see himself in their absence at some rest, not thinking that they would come again,
            when
            instantly he felt that the bed and the clothes were pulled away from him by the outermost
            corners: and he saw at the same time, a man come in with a torch in his <span class="body">hand</span> lighted, followed by two others, the one with a great brazen basin, and the
            other sharpening a little knife. Then began he to tremble, and all his <span class="body">hair</span> stood on end, he would have spoken but he was not able. When they were near
            him, he who held the torch put it out, and <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> thinking that
            they would kill him, and that the basin was to receive his blood, put his <span class="body">hands</span> forth against the knife, and felt that they laid hold of him; he gave a
            great cry, and the torch instantly kindled again: and he saw himself between two great
            mastiff dogs, who held him fast in their <span class="body">teeth</span>. Jesus! cried out
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, at which name all these fantastic illusions vanished
            away, leaving him so <span class="emotion" title="adj">weary</span> and so affrighted with their
            company that he would not stay there any longer: but going out into the garden by
            which he
            was entered, he went to the chamber of the good hermit, who seeing him so pale, weak
            and
            naked opened him the door, and said to him; have your hosts here given you an evil
            night’s
            lodging? So ill, said <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, that I have not rested all night,
            and yet I have left them my clothes to pay for it. The good man received him as well
            as he
            could; telling him how many others with like success had been so used, and many other
            discourses, wherewith he passed away the night until morning.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">Those who do not know the nature, quality and condition of spirits, will account this
            history a fable: wherefore I do not think it unfit to advertise them that there are
            some,
            fallen from the lowest choir of angels, who despite the essential pain, which is the
            eternal privation from the sight of God, suffer less pain than the other, as not having
            so
            much sinned. And those are of such nature that they cannot much hurt men, but do take
            <span class="emotion" title="noun">pleasure</span> to displease them; with frightings, noises,
            rumours, subtleties and such like other things which they do in the night in houses,
            which
            thereby they make altogether uninhabitable, not being able otherwise to hurt but by
            these
            foolish and ridiculous effects, limited and bound by the almighty power of God. These
            the
            Italians call fairies, the Spaniards elves and the French hobgoblins; of whose mockery
            and
            sports <span class="persName">William Totan</span> speaks in his book War of the Devils, calling
            them devils of the least noble hierarchy. <span class="persName">Cassian</span> writes that in
            <span class="placeName">Norway</span> they possess highways, play with passenger, and do hire
            themselves out for wages as servants. <span class="persName">Jerome Manchy</span> reports of a
            spirit which was in <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> with a young man, served him,
            solicited him in divers forms and stealing money bought him many things wherein he
            delighted. <span class="persName">Michel Pselho</span> makes six kinds of these spirits: fiery,
            airy, earthy, watery, subterranean and fire flying spirits: in all which authors one
            may
            see, their properties, their illusions, and their remedies.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">The light of day, which is the amiable and illustrious daughter of heaven, and the
            only
            guide of mortals, did sufficiently assure <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> that now he need
            not any more to <span class="emotion" title="noun">fear</span> the evil infestation of the
            spirits: then waking this good man, they both rose, and went together to the chamber
            where
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> lay: but entering in to see the stir that was made the
            last night, they found the bed, <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’ clothes and all other
            things in the same place where they had laid, without any appearance that they had
            been
            stirred. Whereat <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> being ashamed, with haste made himself
            ready without speaking a word, and thinking that this good hermit would account him
            for a
            great liar and a man of weak courage, departed from him, and thence took his way towards
            <span class="placeName">Guadalupe</span> without once daring to turn his <span class="body">head</span> towards the city, vowing to himself never to come into it again upon any
            occasion whatsoever should happen, if he were not assured to find his
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span> there.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">There are two hills in the confines of the mountain of <span class="placeName">Morena</span>,
            which as two strong walls environ the town and monastery of
            <span class="placeName">Guadalupe</span>, with so many fountains which run from the rocks into
            the bottom of the valley, so much fruit and so much grain of all sorts that it seems
            Nature knowing that which should happen, had destined this place from the beginning
            of the
            world to build this palace to the princess of heaven. The pilgrim being come thither
            and
            having adored the Virgin, visited the temple and paid his vow: as he went back again
            down
            the stairs, at that time of the year when the sun is equally distant between the two
            Poles; he met a passenger going towards the temple, who earnestly beholding him asked
            him
            if he had not known either there or in any other place, a pilgrim of
            <span class="placeName">Madrid</span> called <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, who lately was in
            <span class="placeName">Aragon. </span><span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, troubled with this demand
            and <span class="emotion" title="verb">fearing</span> that he was sought after with some warrant
            from the justice for <span class="persName">Godfrey</span>’s death, turned back and fled towards
            the temple; but the Aragonese by some tokens which were given him, and by his sudden
            flight, presuming that it was he, followed him and courteously calling him said, stay
            knight; I am not come to apprehend you, neither doth the privilege of this place permit
            any man to be arrested prisoner here. It is only a letter from a young lady called
            <span class="persName">Flerida</span>, which I bring you: see thereby what I am, and for what
            occasion I seek you. <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> then staying took the letter, and
            having opened it, found the contents as follows:<br /></p>
         
         
         <div class="floating">
            
            
            <p class="letter">To the <span class="persName">Pilgrim</span> of <span class="placeName">Madrid</span>:
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="prose">Thou thyself O <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> may judge in what care thou left me, if
               thou hast had never so little thought of me since thou left me. And now as well to
               satisfy myself as to know how thy misfortunes are determined, have I sent this
               messenger to you. My brothers being returned and missing thee in the prison where
               they
               had left thee, witnessed more <span class="emotion" title="noun">sorrow</span> for thy
               departure then for my brother <span class="persName">Godfrey</span>’s death. But a few days
               after, a woman of the country falling out with another, amongst other words (which
               choler provoked, a thing ordinary amongst women) said she was the cause of
               <span class="persName">Godfrey</span>’s death. Being thereupon taken, and having confessed
               that <span class="persName">Tansiles</span> killed him out of <span class="emotion" title="noun">jealousy</span>, he was apprehended, and the crime being verified, the third day
               after he had his <span class="body">head</span> cut off. My mother and my brother being now
               assured of thy innocence doe bewail their hard usage towards thee, and have made great
               search to find thee. If thou wilt return, they will redeem the injury of thy unjust
               Imprisonment with embraces and kind usage, and thou shalt thereby pay me for the <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> which I continually have of thy welfare, and
               for the tears which thou hast cost me.<br /></p>
            
            
         </div>
         
         
         <p class="prose">The pilgrim wondered at <span class="persName">Tansiles</span>’ strange fate, and was something
            moved in his mind with <span class="persName">Flerida</span>'s loving desires: but <span class="emotion" title="verb">fearing</span> to offend <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, he satisfied
            the messenger as well as he could, giving him the jewels which
            <span class="persName">Flerida</span> had given him, entreating that he would secretly deliver
            them, together with a most kind letter to her, which he presently wrote, and so the
            same
            day dispatched away the messenger, who went his way very <span class="emotion" title="adj">joyful</span> that he had in so short a time so <span class="emotion" title="adverb">happily</span> dispatched his business: for <span class="persName">Flerida</span> not thinking he
            could easily find him, had commanded him to search him in every house where pilgrims
            were
            used to lodge throughout all <span class="placeName">Spain</span>. I do here remember that I heard
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> say, after he had retired himself to covert from the
            storm of his fortunes, that he never in all his life found anything so difficult as
            to
            resist <span class="persName">Flerida</span>'s desire, for besides the obligations wherein he stood
            tied, which were very great and no less than for his life, she was most perfectly
            fayre;
            yet he continued his loving friendship by letters, not only with her but with her
            brothers
            also, until that she being married with a knight of <span class="placeName">Andalucia</span> was
            carried into the <span class="placeName">Indies</span>.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">Ten times had the sun circled heaven in the time of the year when as Astrea doth equal
            the balances of the Equinoctial, when <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> journeying night and
            day through deserts and unknown ways found himself one morning when the day began
            to smile
            on him at the side of craggy mountains, oppressed both with <span class="emotion" title="noun">weariness</span> and hunger, and much more with the remembrance of
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, where sitting at the <span class="body">foot</span> of an oak
            beholding the solitariness of the fields and the murmuring of the little brooks which
            fell
            precipitately from the mountain, he heard a flute played upon, to the sound whereof
            turning his <span class="body">eyes</span>, he saw a man sitting between two rocks amidst a
            flock of sheep, which seemed to leave their feeding to hearken to his music.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">But <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> having other discourses in his <span class="body">head</span> went to him, and wishing health to him, (which he could not obtain for
            himself) and courteously again saluted by the shepherd, who having nothing that savoured
            of rusticness but his apparel, made him know in a few reasons his understanding; and
            the
            other quickly discerned in the pilgrim that he had more need of meat than discourse.
            Wherefore getting fire out of two laurel sticks which for that purpose he carried
            with
            him, they poorly fed of that which <span class="persName">Fabio</span> (for so was this shepherd
            called) had willingly dressed, the ground serving them for a table, the grass for
            napkins,
            and bubbling brooks for their drink and music. They passed away the best part of the
            day
            in telling their adventures: and when it grew night, they retired themselves into
            a little
            village, whether <span class="persName">Fabio</span> led <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> to keep his
            master’s oxen, who was a farmer of a grange which <span class="persName">Nisa</span>’s father had
            in the mountains. <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> was <span class="emotion" title="adj">glad</span> of this condition, hoping that by this means he might with time have news of
            his mistress. By the way <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> entreated
            <span class="persName">Fabio</span> to relate the cause of his retiring into this place, who
            although that this request brought to his mind a great deal of <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span> and <span class="emotion" title="noun">passion</span>, yet after some
            sighs he shortly told him that he was borne in Biscay, and descended of most noble
            parents
            who were careful to fit him in his youth with qualities answerable to his birth, wherein
            he profited so well, that he neither raised discontentment in his parents nor shame
            to his
            tutors; but after growing more ripe in years, and incited with the courageous heat
            of
            youth. In those times, when the English with their warlike ships ravaged along our
            coasts,
            as well of <span class="placeName">Spain</span> as the islands, and oftentimes with their <span class="emotion" title="adj">desperate</span> resolutions made themselves masters of our
            Indian gold, I put myself to sea in one of the King’s armadas, as well with an intent
            to
            gain honour by my valour, as experience in those services, thereby to be the abler
            to
            serve my country wherein I was so fortunate (because I will not say too much) that
            I got
            command myself, and by taking and executing two or three of those pirates was in a
            fair
            way both of grace with the King, and renown in the world, when my <span class="body">eyes</span> were the instruments whereby the most excellent and admirable beauty of
            <span class="persName">Albiana</span> captivated my <span class="body">heart</span> so powerfully that
            all other courses set apart, I was enforced to give myself wholly to her service,
            wherein
            after some small time, I had so <span class="emotion" title="adj">happy</span> a progression,
            that she did confess she was obliged by my perseverance, and by the opinion which
            the
            world held of me, to esteem of me and of my service: thus <span class="emotion" title="adverb">happily</span> in her favour I spent some time, until it fortuned some English slaves
            which I had, endeavouring to make an escape but by my soldiers and mariners prevented,
            I
            inflicted a cruel punishment on them, bound thereunto by that common policy which
            exacts
            from masters, a severe <span class="body">hand</span> over their mutinous slaves; especially I
            used it towards one, who more eminent then the rest, as well in regard of his person
            as
            that he was a chief author of their attempt, which <span class="persName">Albiana</span> with most
            earnest prayers to me sought to divert, were it out of a pitiful compassion, ordinary
            in
            most women, or that she took any special liking to him. But I having more care at
            that
            time to execute my rage, then mindful of her importunity, (which I did not think would
            have turned to that consequence) for example sake, which as it is powerful, so is
            it most
            necessary, especially amongst men of our profession, who serve ourselves with multitudes
            of them, persevered in having him soundly punished. Whereat she discontented, though
            with
            little show thereof, under<span class="body">hand</span> wrought such means by her friends at
            court, before I imagined any such thing, that the slave was by messenger from the
            Duke of
            Lerma, and by warrant under the King’s <span class="body">hand</span> fetched from me, and the
            next day she did let me know that any denial to a woman effects her <span class="emotion" title="noun">hatred</span>; for she sent me a letter wherein she said I was a cruel monster,
            and that she was so far from loving and esteeming me, that she would ever <span class="emotion" title="verb">hate</span> my barbarous nature, and she wondered that any
            valour could be lodged where cruelty had such a habitation; to conclude she told me
            that I
            should never come in her sight, nor be where she might hear of my name. How grievous
            this
            was to me gentle sir may easily be guessed if you knew the extremity of my <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, which was so much that I presently without the
            knowledge of any of my friends took such order as I could with my command, and retired
            myself into these desert places, where I am resolved under this disguised habit to
            end my
            days; seeing that <span class="persName">Albiana</span> will have it so, who whether her complaints
            were just or no, or whether they but serve to colour her inconstancy, shall be always
            <span class="emotion" title="verb">loved</span> and truly ob<span class="body">eye</span>d by me, to
            whom only this comfort is left: that though life hath left me, death will take me.
            Before
            <span class="persName">Fabio</span> had finished this short discourse, they had discovered the
            village where <span class="persName">Alfesibus</span> did keep <span class="persName">Nisa</span>'s father’s
            cattle, in the best house of the village, which for a country house was a fair one.
            <span class="persName">Alfesibus</span> received <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, and informed by
            <span class="persName">Fabio</span> of his intent he agreed with him for wages; and after an evil
            supper and a worse lodging he passed the night <span class="emotion" title="adverb">miserably</span>. And when morning appeared, <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> went after
            his oxen to the solitary fields, where he lived some time free from the confused noises
            of
            the cities, with a good leisure to meditate on his adventures.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">In the meantime <span class="persName">Nisa</span> healed of her wounds and knew that she had
            received them from her own brother out of <span class="emotion" title="noun">jealousy</span>
            which he had conceived against her for <span class="persName">Finia</span>. And entreating her good
            host that he would have <span class="emotion" title="noun">pity</span> on her blood, by both
            their means his pardon and liberty was obtained, the one soliciting, and the other
            forbearing the prosecution. One of the wounds which <span class="persName">Nisa</span> had received
            was in her left side, and as in the dressing it could not be avoided but that she
            was
            known to be a woman, although she had conjured her host to keep it secret from his
            family,
            yet it was impossible: because that his son <span class="persName">Thesander</span> unhappily one
            day was at her dressing and transported so into his mind the wounds which she had
            in her
            <span class="body">body</span>, that within a few days, he fell sick by force of this
            continual thought, not being able to receive into his imagination any thought, but
            the <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> of this beauty. For all the heaven of <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> moves between these two poles, imagination and <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span>. And then his <span class="body">body</span> is as full
            of imaginary and fantastic figures as the astrologer’s globe.
            <span class="persName">Thesander</span> did all that he could to divert himself from this
            thought, and as evils are healed by their contraries, he proposed to his <span class="body">eyes</span> other objects, and other cares to his imaginations: But as art is made out of
            many experiences which were wanting to <span class="persName">Thesander</span>, he rather found the
            evil than the remedy. For it is impossible that young men should know much, because
            that
            to be wise requires experience, and that is gotten with time.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose"><span class="persName">Nisa</span> was much <span class="emotion" title="verb">grieved</span> at
            <span class="persName">Thesander</span>’s <span class="emotion" title="noun">passion</span>, although he
            had never spoken to her about it. But as he which is <span class="emotion" title="adj">amorous</span> so often speaks as he looks on that which he <span class="emotion" title="verb">loves</span>, she easily read in his looks the depth of his thoughts; and willing to
            disabuse him so, that not being understood by others, she might let him understand
            the
            vanity of his <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, one night after she was healed,
            being entreated by all the company, she sang these verses following:<br /></p>
         
         
         <div class="song">
            
            I wot not what is <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, nor yet his flame,<br />
            Nay more, to know it I have not the mind:<br />
            In others, twill suffice a man may find,<br />
            The woes this tyrant in their souls doth frame.<br /> 
            That I for him do sigh he cannot say,<br /> 
            He masters not my will, that bideth free:<br /> 
            His bad and my good nature disagree,<br /> 
            And free, me from his empire’s laws for aye.<br /> 
            To cast his darts elsewhere, I him require,<br /> 
            My <span class="body">heart</span> (as rocks of brass) doth scorn his might:<br /> 
            Let him not grieve, I from him take my flight,<br /> 
            Because I am all ye, and he all fire.<br />
            
            
         </div>
         
         
         <p class="prose">But they rather increased the fire which was too much kindled in
            <span class="persName">Thesander</span>’s soul, who taking the lute from
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span> answered her with these verses, which he had conceived in his
            mind the night before:<br /></p>
         
         
         <div class="song">
            
            The great God’s supreme power to deny,<br />
            Unto my soul as rashness I do hold:<br />
            This to deny with truth I may be bold:<br /> 
            Mine evil, nor yet myself I can destroy.<br /> 
            My knowledge, <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> hath ravished whom you blame,<br /> 
            I think he hath no might nor yet discretion:<br /> 
            If I be thus tormented for confession.<br /> 
            You that deny his power feel not the same.<br /> 
            He makes the widest breach in strongest brass,<br /> 
            From coldest ice, he greatest fire can draw:<br /> 
            Not one can fight him; for none ever saw,<br /> 
            Ought else his shafts in swiftness to surpass.<br />
            
            
         </div>
         
         
         <p class="prose">Very aptly might <span class="persName">Nisa</span> at that time have revenged the motions which
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> had to agree to <span class="persName">Flerida</span>'s will: if
            <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> had been a spirit (as some have believed) which
            might have told them to her.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">But it was not just that so rare a faith should be spotted with any infamy.
            <span class="persName">Thesander</span>’s <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> in the
            meantime, springing from this first spark and increased by <span class="persName">Nisa</span>'s
            resistance, like a fire which a little water makes more violent; or like palm trees
            growing most, when a weight is laid on them.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose"><span class="persName">Nisa</span> waxed strong and walked abroad, when <span class="emotion" title="adj">desperate</span>
            <span class="persName">Thesander</span> revealed himself to a physician, who encouraged him either
            to manifest his evil or else as the best remedy, against his <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> to work from his imagination this deep <span class="emotion" title="noun">melancholy</span>, and to divert it by some honest exercise, and that the courage of the
            practiser is the first matter on which the heavens imprint the form of their succours,
            for
            as much as their favour is not obtained by womanish prayers and vows but by the vigorous
            actions of men, agreeing to which the Greek adage says that the Gods do sell their
            blessings unto men, in exchange of their labours. <span class="persName">Thesander</span> was
            animated by these counsels, but finding that divisions were weak remedies against
            the
            splendour of <span class="persName">Nisa</span>’s beauty, fell into a relapse, and grew so weak
            that he was constrained to reveal the cause of his sickness. The <span class="emotion" title="adj">pitiful</span> father who was already informed of <span class="persName">Nisa</span>'s
            quality conjured her with tears to be mistress of his wealth, and marry his son, of
            whose
            sickness there was no other remedy: <span class="persName">Nisa</span> admiring at the several ways
            whereby fortune sought to separate her from <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, revealed then
            to the good old man the whole history of her life, and laid before him all the
            impossibilities which did excuse her from satisfying so many courtesies; the chiefest
            whereof was, in his willingness to admit her to the highest degree of honour and affection
            that was possible for him to do, she being a stranger, and in such an indecent habit,
            for
            a woman fit to be his son’s wife. By this means she satisfied the father: but poor
            <span class="persName">Thesander</span> was so desperate that falling into greater extremity, he
            was at the last point of his life; like unto trees whose boughs do not lose their
            greenness until that their humour which doth quicken them do absolutely fail, because
            that
            hope is the radical moisture which doth keep us alive, and is to us as oil to our
            fire.
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span> seeing that <span class="persName">Thesander</span> was for her sake
            upon the point of losing his life, and she herself had not now lived, but out of his
            father’s <span class="emotion" title="noun">pity</span>, was exceedingly perplexed that she could
            not satisfy so just an obligation: and not being able to rest in these confused thoughts,
            the representations of <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’ labours did always appear in her
            mind, who she thought to be prisoner still at <span class="placeName">Valencia</span>.
            <span class="persName">Thesander</span>’s evil increased, <span class="persName">Nisa</span> deferred the
            remedy, and the father accused this poor <span class="emotion" title="adj">amorous</span> man, in
            my opinion innocent, because, that in things natural, we do neither merit nor demerit:
            In
            brief, all the whole family entreated <span class="persName">Nisa</span> that she would have <span class="emotion" title="noun">pity</span> of <span class="persName">Thesander</span>’s young years, and
            that at the least she would assuage his passion with one <span class="emotion" title="adj">amorous</span> word.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">Amongst all the variable fortunes as well by land as sea which our pilgrim had suffered,
            there was none so difficult for her as this. Nevertheless she resolved to entertain
            <span class="persName">Thesander</span> until he had recovered some strength, that thereby he
            might the better be able to bear the subtlety which she intended. And in this she
            did not
            deceive herself, for our spirits have some resemblance with the nature of young horses,
            which are easier managed with gentle bits than with hard; the sweet words, the feigned
            hopes and embraces of <span class="persName">Nisa</span> within few days restored
            <span class="persName">Thesander</span>’s weakened spirit, during which time
            <span class="persName">Celio</span> was delivered out of prison with an exceeding desire to see
            her, as well because he had heard news of her health, as because he imagined that
            if
            <span class="persName">Finia</span> were not in her company, yet at the least he might hear some
            news of her. Nevertheless the sorrowful <span class="persName">Nisa</span> believing that
            <span class="persName">Celio</span>
            <span class="emotion" title="verb">desired</span> to kill her, not knowing what
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> had told him of her disguising herself in the habit of a
            pilgrim; so soon as she heard of his freedom, fled secretly from
            <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>. In the meantime <span class="persName">Lisard</span> the eldest
            brother to <span class="persName">Celio</span> and <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, who as you heard was
            a soldier in <span class="placeName">Flanders</span>, disembarking in the same town of
            <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>, far from thinking that persons so near him were there:
            having met with <span class="persName">Finia</span> on the way, on the first day of her travel,
            although almost in the last of the tragical comedy of her fortunes, sorry to see so
            fair a
            pilgrim go a-foot, understanding which way she was bound, offered to accompany her
            into
            <span class="placeName">Castile</span>: <span class="persName">Finia</span> willing to be gone from
            <span class="persName">Celio</span>, whom she thought never to be able to appease, and not
            knowing that this was his brother, accepted his offer and went with him to
            <span class="placeName">Toledo</span>. Where being received of his parents with all kinds of <span class="emotion" title="noun">joy</span>, his <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> was
            that <span class="persName">Finia</span> might also be well entertained and kindly used, telling
            them in what manner he had found her. His parents received her with a great deal of
            honour
            and embraces, yet not without some suspicions that she was some spoil of the
            <span class="placeName">Flanders</span> war. <span class="persName">Lisard</span> then asked for his
            brother <span class="persName">Celio</span> and for his sister <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, they
            telling him the cause of their absence. <span class="persName">Finia</span> thereby knew that the
            house wherein she was come was her husband’s father’s, and that he who had brought
            her
            thither was his brother, whereat not sufficiently wondering, she then thought that
            fortune
            began to look on her misfortunes with a more clear countenance.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">The day following, <span class="persName">Lisard</span> resolving to seek for his sister
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span> and to kill <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, told his parents
            that he had some pretensions at the court, on which he built the necessity of a new
            voyage, showing them some attestations in writing of that which he had done in
            <span class="placeName">Flanders</span>, for which he hoped of good recompense. His Father
            perspicuously knowing his mind through his reasons, wherewith he endeavoured to colour
            his
            journey, and <span class="emotion" title="verb">fearing</span> to lose him with the other,
            propounded a thousand objections, telling him that he should now rest after his voyage,
            and from the travails of war, contenting himself with the honour which he had gotten,
            because that in this age the reward did fly from the merit. <span class="persName">Lisard</span>
            thus persuaded by his father remained in the house, although it <span class="emotion" title="verb">grieved</span> him that after he had bought so much renown with the loss of his
            blood so far from his own country, he should now lie still and rust with infamy; finally
            being discontent that he was beheld as he thought with this mark, he went into the
            country
            to shun the first encounter of the people’s sight, into the same village where amongst
            the
            other servants of his father’s farmer, <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> lived, who was never
            before known of <span class="persName">Lisard</span>; and as one day he beheld him more curiously
            then he did all the others, for hardly could the baseness and indignity of his habit
            disguise his person and beauty; he called him to him, and inquired of the cause, why
            he
            lived in this base office. The excuses which he made did not seem current (indeed
            being
            feigned by <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, who already knew that
            <span class="persName">Lisard</span> was <span class="persName">Nisa</span>'s eldest brother). Wherefore
            <span class="persName">Lisard</span> said to him that he should do better if leaving this rustic
            life, he would abide in his service and take the charge of two horses which he had,
            for
            which he would give him wages, and convenient clothes; <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>
            refused this offer, not that he was not willing to return into the <span class="emotion" title="adj">happy</span> house in which he had first known <span class="persName">Nisa</span>: but
            <span class="emotion" title="verb">fearing</span> that being known in her absence, he should
            run a dangerous fortune of his life. Nevertheless, being <span class="emotion" title="adj">weary</span> of the austere life which he led amongst these mountains, for there is
            nothing more true (as the philosophers say) than that those which are solitary are
            either
            gods or devils, he resolved in the end to accept this condition, wishing rather that
            he
            might die by <span class="persName">Nisa</span>'s parents’ <span class="body">hands</span>, then live
            any longer in these solitary deserts.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">Now you see how forward we are in bringing back our pilgrim from his long travels,
            seeing
            that from being a courtier, he became a soldier; from a soldier, a captive; from a
            captive, a pilgrim; from a pilgrim, a prisoner; from a prisoner, a madman; from a
            madman,
            a herdsman; from a herdsman, a <span class="emotion" title="adj">miserable</span> lackey, in the
            same house where all his misfortunes began: to the end that you seeing this circle
            of
            fortune from one pole to another, without one moment of rest, or any of good in the
            beginning, middle or end of his adventures: you may learn to know, how travelling
            abroad
            brings honour, profit and many times the contrary. All consists in the disposition
            of
            heaven, whose influence guides the passages of our life, as it pleases them; because
            that
            although the empire of free-will be above, yet few persons be found who resist their
            motions; it is therefore a weakness unworthy of a gentle <span class="body">heart</span> not to
            dare hazardously to enterprise anything, seeing it is evident that if those who have
            effected great things had not begun them, they had never achieved them. As also hazardous
            enterprises belong only to brave courage; although heaven disposes of the success.
            Above
            all things the election imports much, as <span class="persName">Propertius</span> says, all things
            are not equal unto all. Seneca tells of an old man who being asked how he could live
            to
            those years in following the court, answered that it was in doing good turns and not
            excepting against injuries; but this patience doth not seem honourable to me, nor
            that it
            is any virtue to serve to live. And if posterity doth render unto everybody his honour,
            as
            Tacitus says, what renown can he leave behind him, who dies as it were in the cradle,
            and
            from his swaddling clouts to his hearse hath hardly shifted a shirt; like the plant
            which
            hath the form of a living lamb, the stock whereof growing out of the ground to the
            <span class="body">stomach</span>, and not being able to eat more grass than that which grows
            round about it, dies for want of nourishment. Glorious was <span class="persName">Darius</span>,
            when being come to the river Tearus, which takes his beginning from two fountains,
            whereof
            the one is hot and the other cold, he caused the famous inscription whereof Herodotus
            speaks to be made: To this place, against the Scythians, came the most famous of all
            men,
            <span class="persName">Darius</span> the son of <span class="persName">Hystaspes</span>. Who hath ever
            obtained anything without running for it? Who hath ever run for it, if he have not
            seen
            it? And what rest can he know, who hath never proved any storm or adversity by sea
            or
            land? For there are no days so sweet and comfortable as those which we spend in the
            <span class="body">arms</span> of our friends, after long travel and great dangers; nor any
            nights so sweet, as those which are spent about the fire with an attentive family,
            unto
            the discourses of one’s former dangers and adventures; as <span class="persName">Ulysses</span>
            within Zacinth to his dear <span class="persName">Penelope</span> and his son
            <span class="persName">Telemachus</span>. So after many divers adventures,
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> comes to the happy day of his rest, and though he were
            not at the siege of <span class="placeName">Troy</span>, nor at the conquest of the New World with
            <span class="persName">Cortes</span>, yet it was no small valour in him to defend himself from so
            many different and perilous assaults of fortune, and in the end to have merited by
            so many
            labours, the rest which shortly he shall <span class="emotion" title="verb">enjoy</span> in his
            own country.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">Whilst these things thus passed in the mountains of <span class="placeName">Toledo</span>,
            <span class="persName">Thesander</span> was being recovered by <span class="persName">Nisa</span>'s loving
            embrace, and she disposed to leave him, as well because his life was assured as because
            that she <span class="emotion" title="verb">desired</span> to assure hers, and deliver herself
            from the care wherewith she was searched after by her brother
            <span class="persName">Celio</span>.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">One night when sleep mastered her lover’s senses, and held a silence over the whole
            family, she went out of the city, and took the way towards Lerida. But night had hardly
            all hid her black <span class="body">head</span>, crowned both with sleep and <span class="emotion" title="noun">fear</span>, when the deceived <span class="persName">Thesander</span>
            waked out of the most <span class="emotion" title="adj">sorrowful</span> dream that could possess
            his fantasy, representing to his imagination the absence of fugitive
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, together with her deceitful words, her sweet disdains, and
            her fair face; a thing which sometime happens principally to him which loves or fears.
            Inasmuch as those things which threaten us do represent to us in sleeping, the same
            cares
            which we have in the day awake. <span class="persName">Thesander</span> rising in this imagination,
            began to search <span class="persName">Nisa</span> guided by the light of his soul, and not finding
            her, it little wanted that he did not die with <span class="emotion" title="noun">grief</span>
            for her departure; neither his father nor the rest of his parents had power enough
            to keep
            him from running after. And so he came to <span class="placeName">Toledo</span> a long time before
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, for a lover who follows that which he <span class="emotion" title="verb">loves</span> doth go faster than he who flies from that which he doth not <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>; because he which doth not <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> grows sorrowful in going, and he which <span class="emotion" title="verb">loves</span> by going puts off his grief.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">In the meantime, <span class="persName">Lisard</span> much pleased with
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’ understanding and person, had taken him to wait in his
            chamber, not suffering him to live in the baseness of his first office which he had
            given
            him, and in this quality he lived at <span class="placeName">Toledo</span> with his master, always
            taking great care that his master’s parents might not see him, because that if they
            had
            viewed him with any consideration, they must needs have known him. But
            <span class="persName">Lisard</span> who with frequent conversation with
            <span class="persName">Finia</span> (whom his parents did use as <span class="emotion" title="adverb">lovingly</span> as they could have done <span class="persName">Nisa</span>) was fallen in <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> with her, revealed this to
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, and making him the minister of his <span class="emotion" title="noun">passion</span>, gave him charge to speak to her, and to dispose her (with all
            his power) to be favourable to his <span class="emotion" title="verb">desires</span>;
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> obeying his master and taking occasion one festival day,
            when everybody was abroad, went to find <span class="persName">Finia</span> from
            <span class="persName">Lisard</span>: but when in coming to her he knew her to be his sister, and
            she knew him to be her brother, they both remained <span class="emotion" title="adj">astonished</span>, dumb and as immovable as stones. But shortly after this first
            confusion, <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> began to speak in this manner: Sister, tell me
            by what means thou came hither, since <span class="persName">Celio</span> abandoning thee left thee
            in <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>, for I know already the whole progress of thy
            misfortune, as conformable unto mine as we are equal in birth.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">By his means whom the destinies pleased, said <span class="persName">Finia</span>, to whose
            disposing my will cannot resist: <span class="persName">Lisard</span> brother of my husband
            <span class="persName">Celio</span>, having found me on the way from
            <span class="placeName">Saragossa</span> brought me hither, where I think I may abide his return
            with more honour. The same man said <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, sent me to thee to
            speak to thee about his <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, and he having found me in
            a grange which he hath in the mountains of <span class="placeName">Toledo</span>, where I had
            sheltered myself from the strokes of fortune, under the basest condition of the world,
            hath brought me now into this place where thou now see me in the quality of a groom;
            and
            because that heretofore in the beginning of my fortunes I have been in this house,
            I kept
            myself from being seen until this time, as thou may well know, having not been seen
            until
            this day by thee. Suffer and abide the end of thy fortune as I have done, and do not
            say
            thou know me, for I will entertain <span class="persName">Lisard</span> with some lie from thee,
            until such time that we may see whereunto the revolution of this conjunction of our
            misfortunes will tend, and when will end the effects of this our honour’s eclipse.
            Thus
            did <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> and <span class="persName">Finia</span> meet, and instead of
            reprehending one the other they remained there both good friends, for it is ordinary
            with
            those who are culpable to dissemble the faults of others, lest they be reprehended
            for
            their own. In the meantime, <span class="persName">Thesander</span> went from place to place in
            <span class="placeName">Toledo</span> inquiring for <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, and when this
            news came to <span class="persName">Lisard</span>’s ears, that there was a young man which enquired
            for his sister, he verily thought that it was <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, who by some
            sinister accident having lost her, was come thither to find her. And telling
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> the story of <span class="persName">Nisa</span>'s ravishing, which
            he knew much better, told him, that he was now in <span class="placeName">Toledo</span> in her
            quest; and that having no man, in whose <span class="body">hands</span> he could better commit
            the satisfaction of his revenge than his, nor of whose courage and fidelity he could
            be
            better assured of, he entreated him, and conjured him to kill him. A notable winding
            in a
            success so strange and so embroiled, which is so much the more admirable to me, who
            know
            it better then they who read it, how true it is.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose"><span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, <span class="emotion" title="adj">astonished</span> to see that
            he was engaged to kill <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, or at the least a man who either in
            searching for <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, or else one who for the only disaster of his name
            deserved to die, endeavoured to find him, rather to know what he would with
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span> than with any mind to execute <span class="persName">Lisard</span>’s
            intent on the others innocence. His master did not accompany him in this action; for
            as
            Tacitus says of Nero, although he commanded murders, yet he always turned his sight
            away
            from them.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose"><span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> having found <span class="persName">Thesander</span> privately
            inquired of the cause why he searched for <span class="persName">Nisa</span>:
            <span class="persName">Thesander</span> recounted the story from <span class="persName">Nisa</span>'s
            being wounded by <span class="persName">Celio</span>, and healed by his father, and that she had
            left them one night without bidding them adieu, paying with ingratitude all the good
            offices which were done her in that house. Neither did he forget to relate how she
            (for
            the dressing of her wound) being constrained to expose her <span class="body">breast</span>,
            she was discovered to be a woman; from whence proceeded his <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> and the cause why he sought her in this place, which she said was the place
            of her birth. Joyful was <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> to hear of the healing of
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>'s wounds, and instead of killing
            <span class="persName">Thesander</span> he led him into his chamber, where having used him with
            all the courtesy that was possible, he told him that in this house where he remained
            were
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>'s parents and brother.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose"><span class="persName">Lisard</span> having a great opinion of <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’
            courage (<span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> whom he called <span class="persName">Maurice</span>) did
            verily believe that he would infallibly kill <span class="persName">Nisa</span>'s ravisher, which
            he believed to be <span class="persName">Thesander</span>, wherefore he demanded leave of his
            father to go, <span class="emotion" title="verb">fearing</span> that if
            <span class="persName">Maurice</span> should perhaps be taken prisoner, he might confess the
            author of <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’ death. The father afflicted at his departure,
            <span class="emotion" title="verb">fearing</span> that in this his age, death might take him in
            the absence of all his children, would know the cause of his journey: and
            <span class="persName">Lisard</span> telling him that he had sent to kill him, who had run away
            with his sister, who was come to <span class="placeName">Toledo</span>, and that he did believe
            that his servant unto whom he had given this commission had already executed it, put
            the
            old man into a greater care then he was in before, much <span class="emotion" title="verb">fearing</span> the damage which might come from so violent a revenge:
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> had persuaded <span class="persName">Thesander</span> to call
            himself <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> to all those who should ask his name in
            <span class="placeName">Toledo</span>, assuring him that he should the sooner hear news of
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span>: In this time <span class="persName">Lisard</span> and his Father
            coming into <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’ chamber, to know how he had succeeded in the
            execution of his command, found <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> and
            <span class="persName">Thesander</span> together. They demanded of <span class="persName">Thesander</span>
            what he was, who answered: that he was <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>.
            <span class="persName">Lisard</span> drew out his sword instantly to kill him, but he was
            withheld by his father, who having already known <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> told his
            son that the other was <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>. <span class="persName">Lisard</span>
            believed that his father told him so to appease him, wherefore he fiercely strove
            to break
            away from his father, that he might kill <span class="persName">Thesander</span>, saying that the
            other was his man <span class="persName">Maurice</span>. The whole family drawn thither by the
            noise and seeing this <span class="emotion" title="noun">rage</span> to prevent greater mischief,
            ran to the magistrates, who hearing the stir raising the neighbours laid
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> and <span class="persName">Thesander</span> in two several
            prisons, until it was verified which was <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, for although that
            <span class="persName">Thesander</span> apprehending the danger began now to say that it was not
            he, was not believed: for all believed that fear made him deny his name. In the meantime
            <span class="persName">Jacinth</span> being whole of his wounds which
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> had given him, sought him all over
            <span class="placeName">Barcelona</span>, and not finding him, believed that he was returned
            into his own country, as well to follow him as hearing that his
            <span class="persName">Lucinda</span> was at <span class="placeName">Madrid</span>, resolved to go
            thither, and passing by <span class="placeName">Saragossa</span> he found the pilgrim
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span> at the entrance of the famous pillar which was built by the
            angels in the time of the apostle who planted religion in <span class="placeName">Spain</span>,
            and having (by many tokens which <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> had told him, and marked
            her out to him) known her, he also made himself known as <span class="persName">Jacinth</span>.
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span> assuring herself of him out of the <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> which she knew was between him and <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>,
            betook her to a habit proper to her sex, and left this pilgrim’s apparel at the walls
            of
            this holy house, together with her staff, which in so many dangers and such long ways
            had
            been so faithful a companion. And so travelling together towards
            <span class="placeName">Madrid</span>, <span class="persName">Nisa</span>
            <span class="emotion" title="verb">desired</span> to seek <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> first in
            his own house, whither being come with <span class="persName">Jacinth</span>, and finding his
            sorrowful mother afflicted for the loss of her children, she comforted her much by
            the
            assurance which she gave to her, that they were both alive, and the hope they put
            her in
            to find them at <span class="placeName">Toledo</span>. The good old lady encouraged by these words
            and persuaded by <span class="persName">Nisa</span> and the great <span class="emotion" title="noun">desire</span> she had to see her children, took her youngest daughter
            <span class="persName">Eliza</span> with her (being her staff and her comfort in her afflictions,
            who in her brother’s absence had increased no less in beauty then
            <span class="persName">Finia</span>, nor in understanding than <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>)
            and went all together to <span class="placeName">Toledo</span>.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">The <span class="emotion" title="adj">miserable</span>
            <span class="persName">Tiberia</span>, <span class="persName">Jacinth</span>’s sister, thinking that her
            treason being discovered, she should be hardly used by her brother as by the disgrace
            and
            danger whereunto she had unjustly exposed him she merited; left
            <span class="placeName">Valencia</span> and with such of the family as would follow her, she
            addressed herself to that city, whether fortune already did seem to call these lovers.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose"><span class="persName">Celio</span> in the meantime <span class="emotion" title="adj">despairing</span>
            to find <span class="persName">Finia</span> or satisfy <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, he for his part
            being more than satisfied of both their innocences, returned to
            <span class="placeName">Toledo</span> and some days before his coming thither he met
            <span class="persName">Tiberia</span>, in whose company as he journ<span class="body">eye</span>d he
            heard news of the combat between <span class="persName">Jacinth</span> and
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>, for which cause he offered her his house to retire to,
            until such time as that writing to her brother, she made her peace with him, which
            might
            be done by the help of his parents, whose assistance he promised.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">In this manner in one day, and in one time, entered into the noble
            <span class="persName">Leonicio</span>’s house: <span class="persName">Aureliana</span>,
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>; mother, <span class="persName">Nisa</span>,
            <span class="persName">Eliza</span>, <span class="persName">Jacinth</span>, <span class="persName">Tiberia</span>
            and he who was most <span class="emotion" title="verb">despaired</span> of,
            <span class="persName">Celio</span>, of whom there was no news expected, being accounted as dead,
            or captive as some had reported. The sudden <span class="emotion" title="noun">joy</span> to see
            <span class="persName">Nisa</span> so beautiful, and <span class="persName">Celio</span> so well, stronger
            in this habit than in that which he had brought home from his studies, before his
            peregrination, bound <span class="persName">Leonicio</span> to shed abundance of tears, and
            <span class="persName">Aureliana</span> could not forbear when she saw her dear
            <span class="persName">Finia</span> so long time lost, and <span class="persName">Celio</span> with tender
            embraces, demanded pardon for his causeless suspicions, and of <span class="persName">Nisa</span>
            for the wounds which he had given her, being ignorant what she was. There was none
            discontented but <span class="persName">Jacinth</span>, who seeing his sister
            <span class="persName">Tiberia</span> in this company without knowing how she came thither, would
            needs take a public satisfaction before all the world. But the authority of so many
            signal
            persons not only stayed him, but obtained pardon from him for his sister’s offence.
            <span class="persName">Thesander</span> and <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span> were taken out of
            prison, and then it was quickly known who was the true <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>:
            whose <span class="emotion" title="adj">happy</span> finding there did so rejoice the whole
            company and the whole town that all the nobility and gentry ran to see him, and <span class="emotion" title="verb">rejoice</span> with their parents for their happy arrival.
            Amongst all which came to this <span class="emotion" title="adj">happy</span> and joyful
            welcoming home were fair <span class="persName">Lucinda</span>, who was married to
            <span class="persName">Jacinth</span>, to satisfy the many obligations wherein she was due.
            <span class="persName">Lisard</span> having opened his <span class="body">eyes</span> upon
            <span class="persName">Tiberia</span>'s beauty, and by the impression which the report of

            <span class="persName">Finia</span>'s made in his mind, clean wiped away his affection of that
            kind to <span class="persName">Finia</span>, he entreated <span class="persName">Jacinth</span> to give her
            to him in marriage, which was easily granted, and with everyone’s consent. And to
            comfort
            <span class="persName">Thesander</span> for the <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span> which he
            bore to <span class="persName">Nisa</span>, he was married to faire <span class="persName">Eliza</span>,
            <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>’ sister, then about fourteen years old.
            <span class="persName">Celio</span>, with <span class="emotion" title="noun">joy</span> to all, married
            <span class="persName">Finia</span>. And <span class="persName">Nisa</span> after so many divers fortunes,
            with the <span class="emotion" title="noun">joy</span> of both their parents, (which was so full
            that it melted them into tears, and almost all the company) was given into the beloved
            <span class="body">arms</span> of her most dear <span class="persName">Pamphilus</span>.<br /></p>
         
         
         <p class="prose">Happy pilgrims of <span class="emotion" title="noun">love</span>, your vows being accomplished,
